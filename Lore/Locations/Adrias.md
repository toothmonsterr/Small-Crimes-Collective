A region that has been colonized by [[Ontus the Brave]] centuries ago. It has recently liberated itself and is currently getting its footing in the world by trading its famed resource [[Aldium]], something that is said to help with powering [[the Light]]. Still it suffers from the colonial shadows and conspiracy as many factions wish to take advantage of a recent unrest of an assassination of a leading figure in the country's independence to get more control of Aldium.
