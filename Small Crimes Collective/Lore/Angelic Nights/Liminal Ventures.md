When the Angelic Night falls, not everything remains what it seems. Those whose souls end up dislocated from their bodies, essentially becoming ghosts, experience a different reality.

Topography starts to fails around doorways and places that are colloquially knows as "liminal spaces", and only the topology of the places remains, leading to a curious disconnect between what one sees and what one walks into.

These changes in the cityscape are not there when the Angelic Night ends- but curiously, the effects and experiences given by them aren't. Get a bruise in there while being a ghost, and the bruise doesn't disappear when the Angelic Night is over.
