Quirks are an **advanced optional rule** that provides strong thematic and mechanical options for Player Characters. The Quirks presented in these pages were written with a ==High Fantasy/Natural Fantasy/Techno Fantasy as the case may be== assumption, but may be used in any campaign. You may also use them as reference to create your own Quirks – but you should only do so if the rest of your group agrees to it.

* A [Player Character] may only ever have **one** Quirk.
* If you use Quirks in your game, it is **strongly suggested** that each Player Character begins play with one. Additionally, no two characters in the same group should have identical Quirks.
* On average, a group of Player Characters with access to Quirks will be able to tackle more challenging situations than what would be normal for their level.
* If it makes sense in the story, a character may lose their current Quirk and gain a different one – discuss this with the group.

## Using Quirks in your Game
Quirks should be seen as a mechanical and narrative reinforcement of your characters’ unique nature. Keep the following in mind:
 * **Quirks shape the game**. Even the less impactful Quirk is a powerful statement about your character and their role in the story. If you pick [[#Heirloom]], you don’t just get “a cool sword” – you get an item with implications. If you pick [[#Glorious Fate]], the prophecy will become a major part of the game. Quirks will take the already heroic Player Characters and kick them up a notch, which can be prove a bit overwhelming. Think carefully before you use them!
 * **Freedom of choice**. You don’t need a Quirk for your character concept to be valid. If your **Identity** is that of a **“Heroine from the Past”**, you shouldn’t feel forced to pick **From a Distant World** for that Identity to be relevant to the story.
 * **How to use Quirks**. These options should be used to bring interesting situations into play, to give your character unique issues and problems to confront, and to provide additional mechanical support for their Traits.
 * **How not to use Quirks**. These options should never be used to make your character stronger than the rest of the group, to steal the spotlight, or to bring sensitive topics that make others uncomfortable into play.

#### Quirk List
<hr>
#### Agitator 

==Techno Fantasy==

>You have been riling people up to fight against oppressors for years, perhaps for justice, perhaps for vengeance. Who is your current main target? Who or what did you lose because of your insubordination? Who or what is hunting you down? 

When you rest inside or near a settlement, you may choose one option: you learn what the locals are mainly angry about or afraid of, or you create a contact that lives and operates in this area – give them a name and specialization, and the Game Master tells you what they ask of you (they might request a payment or need help). 

>>Examples: Miqe the Witch, an expert ritualist willing to help in exchange for rare materials; Two-fingers, a weapon dealer currently held prisoner by the Planetary Security Corps
#### Ancient Weapon 
==Natural Fantasy==

>You don’t fear delving deep in the ancient ruins; from their cold tunnels you have retrieved an unusual weapon, which saved your life in more than one occasion. Where did you find it? When did you stumble upon a similar weapon, and who carried it? 

Together with the rest of your group, create a rare custom weapon (see page 112) worth 1200 zenit or less. 

>>This weapon should have an especially unusual and technological appearance; it can be a good idea to make it a firearm weapon and determine that similar items are rare and mysterious in your world. 

Once per session (approximately four hours of play), the Game Master may give you 1 Fabula Point in order to have sudden complications arise due to the unique nature of the weapon (such as strange machines reacting to its presence, or monsters drawn to the special energy it emits). However, the weapon ca
#### Arboreal 
==High Fantasy and Natural Fantasy==

 > You are a sentient plant creature with humanoid intelligence. Are you the result of a magical experiment, or do you belong to a particular species? Do you resemble a specific type of plant, flower, or tree? What is your relationship with other plant creatures, and with the woods and forests of this world?
 
 Choose a status effect: dazed, enraged, or shaken. You are immune to the chosen status effect. However, you also become Vulnerable to a damage type of your choice: air, bolt, earth, fire, or ice. You also learn one NPC spell (pages 310-311 of the Core Rulebook), but you cannot choose Devastation. If a Magic Check is required, use 【INS + WLP】. Customize the spell as needed (name, damage type, status effects etc.). When you cast this spell while in sunlight, its total MP cost is reduced by 5 (to a minimum of 0 Mind Points)

#### Big Bro
==Natural Fantasy==

>Your travel companions know they can rely on you when it’s time to make camp and catch a precious breath among the constant pressure of your adventure. Who taught you to care for others? Is there anyone among the other Player Characters you see as a younger brother or sister? What special promise did you make them? 

If your group’s campaign does not make use of the optional rule Camp Activities (see page 130), your character still gains access to it. 

Your character gains access to three Camp Activities instead of only two. 

>>If your character gains this Quirk during a campaign that already makes use of Camp Activities, you simply gain access to a single new Camp Activity of your choice. 

When you choose to perform Camp Activities during a Rest, choose one option: you perform two different Camp Activities, whose effects cannot be applied to the same creature; or you perfo
#### Cognitive Ghost 
==Techno Fantasy==

>You are a presence born within the depths of the soul network, straddling the line between demons and humans. Do you remember your earliest moments? What belief, memory or emotion do you embody? How did that shape your appearance? 

Choose two damage types from air, bolt, dark, earth, fire, ice, and light. You gain Resistance to the chosen damage types. However, you also gain Vulnerability to a third damage type chosen from the list above. 

You gain the ability to perform Rituals of the Ritualism discipline, and you may use these Rituals to transport creatures in and out of the soul network, as well as to gain information and track entities while inside the soul network.
#### Cursed 
==High Fantasy & Natural Fantasy==

> You bear the burden of a strange curse. Through which supernatural effects does it manifest? How did you become cursed? Was it a stroke of bad luck, or a form of punishment for something you did? How can the curse be lifted?

When you acquire this Quirk, describe the nature of your curse and tie it to one of the threats present in your world. Once this threat is resolved, you will finally have a chance to break free from the curse – describe how you expect this to happen. 

Examples: weapons you wield often miss their mark; your mere presence instills a sense of dread; your magic has a tendency to trigger unintended results; creatures within arm’s reach of you feel sharp pain across their bodies. 

When you are about to perform a Check, you may instead describe how your curse gets in the way and automatically roll a fumble (both dice are treated as if you had rolled a 1 on them). If you do, you receive 2 Fabula Points instead of 1, and generate an opportunity as normal. 

If you ever manage to break the curse, immediately gain a Heroic Skill of your choice (you may even choose a Heroic Skill whose requirements you do not satisfy, unless they include a Skill you don’t have). This includes choosing a Heroic Skill for a Class you do not have
#### Diabolist 
==Techno Fantasy==

>You have access to a unique talent or device that lets you shape the energies of the soul network into a demonic familiar. How did you obtain this power, and what price did you pay? What does your familiar look like, and what does this say about you? 

Together with your group, create your familiar: a level 5 NPC belonging to the demon Species (see Core Rulebook, page 302). This creature has no initiative score and does not level up, can have a maximum of two basic attacks, gains a +3 bonus to Accuracy Checks and Magic Checks, and their maximum Hit Points are equal to 【five times the familiar’s base Might die size + half your level】. 

When you reach level 20, your familiar gains an additional Skill. At level 40, your familiar gains another additional Skill. Make sure to discuss these Skill choices together with the rest of your group. 

When an NPC you can see that belongs to the demon Species falls to 0 Hit Points, if you are present on the scene, you may spend 20 Mind Points. If you do, the Game Master reveals that creature’s entire profile, and you may replace one of your familiar’s Skills with one of that creature’s Skills (the Game Master has final say on which Skills are eligible and how they apply to your familiar). Describe the transformation! 

If you have this Quirk, you may not acquire the Faithful Companion Skill from the Wayfarer Class (see Core Rulebook, page 217), and vice versa you can’t gain this Quirk if you already acquired Faithful Companion. 

Your familiar doesn’t get an independent turn during conflicts, but you can use an action to have them perform an action (once per turn). If your familiar is affected by any turn-related effects (see Core Rulebook, page 77), these are based on your turn. 

Your familiar joins and leaves scenes when you do, and gains your same benefits for rests. If reduced to 0 Hit Points, your familiar vanishes from the scene and reforms at your side at the start of the next scene in which you are present, with current HP equal to their Crisis score.
#### Elemental Soul 
==High Fantasy and Natural Fantasy==

>You are deeply infused with the power of a natural element. Are you the child of an elemental creature, or did you join souls with some kind of spirit? Who might try to take advantage of your unique nature? Who is afraid of you? 

Choose your elemental damage type: air, bolt, earth, fire, or ice. You gain Resistance to the chosen damage type. Additionally, whenever you deal damage, you may change its type so that it matches your elemental damage type. However, you also become Vulnerable to a different damage type chosen among those five. 

You also gain the ability to perform Rituals of the Elementalism discipline, but only if those Rituals manipulate your chosen element (respectively air, electricity, earth/rock, fire, and ice/water).
#### Empty Hands 
==High Fantasy==

>You have forsaken the use of weapons, instead purely relying on your hands and feet. Did you develop this fighting style out of necessity, or was it a choice? Is it because of your monstrous anatomy? Did your blade take one too many lives in the past? 

Your attacks with unarmed strikes deal 6 extra damage. This amount increases to 10 extra damage if you are level 30 or higher. 

Additionally, while you have no weapons or shields equipped (aside for unarmed strikes), you gain a +1 bonus to Defense and a +1 bonus to Magic Defense.
#### Enigmatic Relic
==Techno Fantasy==

>You possess a strange weapon capable of shaping the weave of reality, an artifact from a forgotten past (or perhaps even a far away future). How did you obtain it, and how did you discover the basics of its functioning? Who is trying to take the relic from you? 

Together with the rest of your group, create a relic: a rare custom weapon (see page 112) worth 1200 zenit or less. The relic is an artifact, may only be destroyed through a PC’s Sacrifice, and may only be stolen from you or lost due to a Surrender. 

As long as a Player Character or Villain has the relic equipped, they may perform the Skill action to have it manifest a power of their choice from among the following: 

* (PCs only) Ask the Game Master a single question. The Game Master answers truthfully and describes the visions shown by the relic. 
* Choose a discipline from among Chimerism, Elementalism, Entropism, Ritualism, and Spiritism. Until the end of the scene, any character who has the relic equipped may perform Rituals of that discipline and their MP cost is halved. 
* Until the end of the scene, all attacks with the relic deal 5 extra damage, and all damage dealt ignores Absorptions, Immunities and Resistances. Additionally, the character may immediately perform a free attack with the relic. 

The second and third options are cumulative with themselves. For instance, using the second option for Chimerism three times within the same scene will make it so that Chimerism Rituals cost 1/8th of the normal MP. 

After the relic manifests a power while in the hands of a Player Character, it generates 1d6 Paradox Points. If the relic’s Paradox Points ever reach 10 or higher, all Paradox Points are immediately lost and the Player rolls a d6: 

* 1–4: the relic becomes completely inert and cannot be equipped until a specific condition is fulfilled (the Game Master decides what it is). 
* 5–6: the relic unleashes a terrible and unprecedented force, causing death and destruction, a serious alteration of time and space, or even the advent of a new threat for the world (Game Master’s choice). 

When a Villain uses the relic’s power, it never generates Paradox Points. 

If you Sacrifice yourself and the relic is not destroyed as part of the Sacrifice, it remains a part of the campaign with all the above rules intact, but can now be lost or stolen like any other object (it can still only be destroyed through a Sacrifice).
#### Fettered Heart 
==High Fantasy==

>For many years you have obeyed the precepts of a certain person or authority; you built your entire existence upon them. Now, however, you begin to see those rules in a darker light, and your heart falters. When did you first doubt them? 

You may acquire this Quirk only if your character’s Theme is Doubt, and your Theme cannot be changed in any way as long as you have this Quirk. 

When you acquire this Quirk, create a Bond towards the Non-Player Character or institution that shaped your life up to now. This Bond begins with three emotions of your choice, and cannot be lost or erased in any way as long as you have this Quirk (you can still reassign its emotions during Resting scenes). Additionally, create three commandments that are crucial to that NPC or institution: each commandment must be something you must always do or something you must never do. 

>>Examples: the Lord of Dragons (always obey a dragon, never show your weakness, never extinguish fire); the Pale Church (always side with the faithful, never doubt the word of a Priest, never lend your ear to a demon). 

The first time you break a commandment during each scene, you immediately suffer the shaken and weak status effects and lose half your current Hit Points and Mind Points (rounded down), but also gain 2 Fabula Points. If you break a commandement during a Resting scene, you will suffer the penalties after the recovery granted by that Rest. 

>>If you break multiple commandments during the same scene, the penalties and Fabula Points only apply to the first violation. 

After breaking your commandments 6 times, ignore any further violation unless it happens in the presence of a Villain who follows or embodies your commandments. If you’re ever unsure whether a situation fits the criteria of this Quirk, it is you who always have final say. Be as honest and sincere as you can. 

Upon your 7th violation, you lose this Quirk and change your Theme to one of the following: Belonging, Guilt, Justice or Vengeance. Then, you immediately gain a Heroic Skill among those available for your Classes (you may even choose a Heroic Skill whose requirements you do not satisfy, unless they include a Skill you don’t have). Finally, you recover all HP and MP and recover from all status effects. From now on, the strength of your Bonds is always treated as being 1 point higher (for instance, a Bond with three emotions will have a strength of 4).
#### Flight 
==High Fantasy and Natural Fantasy==

>You belong to a unique heritage of humanoids who have the ability to fly or levitate. How does this work? Is it magical, or do you have wings? How did this particular advantage shape the history and society of your people? How do people usually react to seeing you? 

You are able to fly. In addition to the obvious advantage in mobility, your melee attacks can target flying creatures and you cannot be targeted by melee attacks unless the attacker is flying or is somehow able to reach flying targets. 

While in Crisis or unable to fly freely (such as when you’re inside a vehicle designed for human-sized creatures or in a narrow corridor), you lose all benefits granted by this Quirk. Additionally, when you suffer air, bolt or ice damage during a conflict scene, you lose the benefits of this Quirk until the start of your next turn.
#### From a Distant World 
==High Fantasy & Techno Fantasy==

>Your presence here is an anomaly, an unexpected knot in the weave of destiny: the rules of this land sometimes fail to bind you. Do you come from a different planet, or perhaps a different time? How did you get here, and when? Do you think you still have a chance to go back, and would you do so? What terrible threat followed you? 

When you participate in a conflict scene, you automatically gain 1 Fabula Point. Additionally, you can invoke a Trait to reroll dice even if you fumbled your Check (if you do so, you do not receive a Fabula Point for the fumble).
#### Fugitive Experiment 
==Techno Fantasy==

>Engineered within a secluded laboratory, you are a being with no precedents. The world is not ready for you, and neither were your creators. How did you escape? What are you searching for? Who was the first person to show you kindness? 

When a rule or ability requires you to spend 100 or fewer Hit Points, Mind Points, or Inventory Points, you may suffer 1d8 Instability Points to ignore that cost. 

At the end of each session (approximately four hours of play), you lose 1d6 Instability Points (to a minimum of zero). 

If your Instability Points ever reach 10 or more, you are immediately reduced to 0 Hit Points and must Surrender. The consequences of this Surrender should be closely tied to you losing control of your abilities. Then, you lose all Instability Points.
#### Glorious Fate 
==High Fantasy==

>There is a prophecy surrounding you, a prophecy of hope for a better world. Who spoke or wrote that prophecy? Do you embrace your destiny, or are you crushed by its weight? Did someone plant seeds of doubt in your heart? 

When you acquire this Quirk, write down the prophecy, and what it foretold. Do this with the collaboration of everyone else in the group, tie it to a known threat or emergency in your world, and describe what sign or omen marks you as the person supposedly destined to fulfill that prophecy. 

Examples: “The boy with the ruby necklace will bring back water to the Desolate Plains”, or “The Branded One shall destroy the Chaos Dragon”. 

At the end of each session (approximately four hours of play), before assigning XP, think carefully and honestly about what happened during the session and choose one of the five options below. The choice is yours to make, but it’s often a good idea to talk about what happened with the rest of the group. 

* The prophecy was fulfilled: lose this Quirk, fully restore your Hit Points and Mind Points, recover from all status effects, and gain a Heroic Skill from those available for your Classes (you may even choose a Heroic Skill whose requirements you do not satisfy, unless they include a Skill you don’t have). 
*  You acted in accordance to the prophecy: fully restore your Hit Points and Mind Points, and recover from all status effects. 
*  You acted neither in accordance to nor against the prophecy: nothing happens. 
*  You acted against the prophecy: gain 1 Fabula Point. 
*  The prophecy can never be fulfilled: lose this Quirk, gain 6 Fabula Points, and gain a Heroic Skill from those available for your Classes (you may even choose a Heroic Skill whose requirements you do not satisfy, unless they include a Skill you don’t have). 
 Once the first or last option is chosen, the role of the prophecy in your world comes to an end. Even if later on in the campaign it appears that a situation might match the words of the prophecy, the effects of this Quirk will no longer be in place: you are free to shape your destiny and act based on your inner moral compass. Or perhaps you always were?
#### Heirloom 
==High Fantasy ==

>You possess one or more pieces of equipment that boast unique properties. Are those items something passed down in your family, or a gift from someone you hold dear? What strange or dangerous rumors surround these items? Who would do anything in their power to take them from you? 

You obtain a single rare item worth 1200 zenit or less, or two rare items worth up to 800 zenit each. You may choose these items from the available lists or design them together with the rest of your group. 

Once per session (approximately four hours of play), the Game Master may give you 1 Fabula Point in order to have sudden complications arise due to the unique nature of the item(s) you carry (such as rival duelists or strange monsters drawn by its magic). Items acquired through this Quirk cannot be destroyed, damaged, lost or stolen without your permission as a Player.
#### Hundred Faces 
==Techno Fantasy==

>You can disguise yourself as pretty much anybody else. Does this ability come from special gadgets, psychic powers, or a unique physiology? Who was the first person to see through your deception? Whose trust did you lose because of it? Who tried to hire you for an unsavory operation, and how did you respond? 

If you are away from prying eyes, you may use the Skill action and spend 1 Fabula Point to disguise yourself as another creature of humanoid size and shape. If the creature is someone you had a chance to meet, observe or research, you may also adopt their voice and mannerisms. 

Your disguise will reliably fool any soldier-rank creature, but elite- and championrank creatures might see through it due to a failed Check or opportunity. If a Villain is present on the scene with you, they may spend 1 Ultima Point to reveal your true identity through sheer coincidence or superior intuition.
#### Inventor Prodigy 
==Techno Fantasy==

>You have a burning passion for technology and strange devices. What innovative yet dangerous discovery have you made, and which shady company is trying to steal that information from you? How do they plan on using it? 

Once per conflict scene, if you need to spend Inventory Points, you can instead ignore that cost. 

You may initiate Projects. If a Project requires a special ingredient or material, you may spend 1 Fabula Point to declare you have that item with you. If you do, the invention must have a terrible flaw (see Core Rulebook, page 134)
#### Mysterious Grimoire
==Natural Fantasy==

>You came into possession of an old and hefty magical tome; sometimes, scribbles and advice appear on its pages, helping you in your adventures. Where did you find it? What kind of personality emerges from the text’s style and tone? 

As long as you have this Quirk, your grimoire is an indestructible artifact that cannot be lost or stolen unless as a consequence of Surrender. 

When your group stumbles upon a danger or discovery after a travel roll, you may ask the Game Master a single question concerning that danger or discovery (you may ask it immediately or save it for later); the Game Master answers truthfully and describes how the answer appears on your grimoire. 

Once your grimoire has answered 10 questions, it almost shared all of its knowledge with you: choose one of the following options. 

* Awakened Consciousness: you lose this Quirk and the grimoire turns into a NonPlayer Character; create this NPC together with the rest of your group, giving them a name and describing their appearance. They do not have an NPC profile and do not take part in Checks or conflicts, but they learn two spells of your choice among those found in the Elementalist, Entropist, and Spiritist lists (see Core Rulebook, pages 188, 192 and 208 respectively). Once per conflict, if requested, the NPC will cast one of these spells. Spells cast this way will be cast at the end of the current round, require no Mind Points, and use 2d10 for the Magic Check (if needed). 
* Hidden Magic: you lose this Quirk, but your grimoire will still share a final and most powerful secret. You acquire a Heroic Skill of your choice among Comet, Extra Spells, Hope, and Volcano (see Core Rulebook from page 232 onwards; you may choose a Skill whose requirements you do not fulfill). 

>>You could also use this Quirk to introduce a new Player Character (and Player) in your group; if you do, the character who had taken this Quirk should receive the benefits listed by Hidden Magic instead of those in Awakened Conscience. Suggested Quirks for a Player Character brought into a campaign this way are Arboreal, Robot, The Beast Who Spoke, and The Long Dream. 

Whatever your choice, the grimoire goes back to being a completely normal book and the Game Master chooses one option: the grimoire provides a key clue regarding a threat that is present in your world; or the grimoire reveals the existence of a new threat and provides a key clue about it.
#### Neo-Human 
==Techno Fantasy==

>You represent the next evolutionary stage of humanity (or at least, one possibility). What gives away your nature? Do you conceal it? Do you have a mentor or someone you deeply respect? Which entity or organization is keeping a close eye on you? 

When you acquire this Quirk, choose Dexterity, Insight, Might, or Willpower. 

When you join a conflict scene, you may choose one option: you increase that Attribute by one die size (up to a maximum of d12) or, if its base die size is d12, you treat it as having a current die size of d20 during Checks you perform (only during Checks, and regardless of status effects). The chosen effect lasts until the end of the scene. 

When you choose one of the above options, the Game Master gains an opportunity which can be spent during the current scene or later, to showcase the unexpected collateral effects of your abilities (such as drawing the attention of a psy
#### Old Transport 
==High Fantasy==

>You own an old vehicle that you love dearly. Unfortunately, the cursed thing barely holds together and won’t stop causing you trouble. Did you build this vehicle yourself, or did you receive it from someone? What very specific flaw or quirk makes it unique? What makes it extremely recognizable? You obtain a transport of your choice from the Core Rulebook (page 125), such as a land vehicle, a ship, or even an airship. The size of this transport is enough to accommodate you and the rest of your group, plus two or three guests, but it is unfit for combat. 

Once per session (approximately four hours of play), the Game Master can give you 2 Fabula Points in order to make the transport’s engines fail, cause an enemy missile to damage its hull, or introduce similar story-based complications. However, the transport can never be destroyed without your permission.
#### Outcast Fairy 
==Natural Fantasy==

>Once upon a time, you lived with your kin in the Realm of Fairies, in close contact with the stream of souls... but it has been long since you last visited. What went wrong? What is the state of the Realm at the moment? Who governs it? 

You may verbally communicate with any creature belonging to the beast, elemental, and plant Species. 

You learn one spell of your choice among those found in the Elementalist, Entropist, and Spiritist lists (see Core Rulebook, pages 188, 192 and 208 respectively); additionally, you gain the ability to perform Rituals whose effects fall within the Ritualism discipline, and you may use these Rituals to transport creatures in and out of the Realm of Fairies. 

However, you also possess a unique weakness typical of fairies: decide it together with your group. Once per session (approximately four hours of play), the Game Master may give you 1 Fabula Point in order to have sudden complications arise due to this weakness or have you automatically fail a Check (they must do so before the Check is performed; the Check’s Result and High Roll are both treated as being 0). 

>>Examples: you are allergic to iron; you must count all poured grains of sand or salt; if you see someone perform a specific gesture, you must do the same
#### Planet Oracle 
==Techno Fantasy==

>The stream of souls itself speaks through your mouth, its suffering carved in centuriesold scars caused by pollution and ruthless experimentation. How does that pain manifest before your eyes? How was this connection formed? 

When you cause one or more allies to recover Hit Points and/or Mind Points, each of those allies recovers 5 additional Hit Points and/or Mind Points and you choose a status effect from among dazed, enraged, poisoned, shaken, slow, and weak: each of those allies recovers from the chosen status effect. The recovery effect increases to 10 Hit Points and/or Mind Points if you are level 30 or higher. 

You also gain the ability to perform Rituals of the Spiritism discipline.
#### Repentant Enforcer 
==Techno Fantasy==

>You were part of a gang, armed group, police force or military unit. Your hands and heart are stained with the blood of innocents. What shocking event led to your defection? Who do you believe will never forgive you, and why are they right not to? 

You may acquire this Quirk only if your character’s Theme is Doubt or Guilt, and your Theme cannot be changed in any way as long as you have this Quirk. 

When you acquire this Quirk, describe the organization you worked for, name the Villain who leads it, and list their three main strategies. That organization becomes a threat for your world. 

>>Examples: the Galaxy Crossroad Corporation (led by Aaron Callisto) who seize natural resources from planets, diminish worker rights and colonize outer space; the Deluvian Security Forces (led by Natalia Caiden) who use excessive force, traffic prototype magitech armaments and spread misinformation; the Peckerson Private Company (led by Ezra Allen) who sabotage peaceful protests, intimidate civilians and infiltrate unions. 

You managed to steal something from the organization: you obtain a single rare item worth 1000 zenit or less. You may choose this item from the available lists or design it along with the rest of your group. 

At the end of each session (approximately four hours of play), if you hindered one or more of the organization’s strategies, or if you remedied some of the harm they have done, gain 1 Subversion Point. 

If you’re ever unsure whether this happened during a given session, it is you who always has the final say. Be as honest and sincere as you can. 

When you need to spend Fabula Points, you may instead spend 1 Subversion Point (regardless of the amount of Fabula Points required). 

Once the Villain leading the organization is defeated and Surrenders, you lose this Quirk, permanently increase your maximum Hit Points and Mind Points by 10, and change your Theme to one of the following: Belonging, Duty, or Justice.
#### Revenant 
==High Fantasy==

>You were brought back after death, unable to peacefully merge with the stream of souls. Do you know why or how this happened? How does your undeath visually manifest? Were you returned to your body, or displaced into a different one? 

You are not considered a living creature and gain Immunity to dark damage and poison damage, but become Vulnerable to light damage. You are also immune to the poisoned status effect.

You do not need to breathe, eat or drink, but you still follow the normal rules for resting. You also recover Hit Points and recover from status effects as normal (contrary to undead creatures, effects that restore HP cannot be used to harm you).

Finally, whenever you deal damage, you may change its type to dark. Additionally, all dark damage you deal ignores Immunities and Resistances.
#### Rival Prodigies
==High Fantasy==

>You possess an incredible talent, making you one of the very best in your field... too bad you’re always one step behind your eternal rival! Who are they, and when did you last face off against each other? Who trained you, and what expectations do they hold about your future? What did you sacrifice to achieve this level of ability? 

When you acquire this Quirk, choose what you specialize in: Rituals, Skills, or spells. Then, say who your eternal rival is: this Non-Player Character becomes a minor Villain (5 Ultima Points), and you create a Bond towards them, with 1 emotion chosen between admiration and inferiority. 

When a rule or ability pertaining to your specialization requires you to spend Hit Points or Mind Points, you may spend 1 Fabula Point instead to completely ignore that cost. 

However, while your rival is present on the scene and has 1 or more Ultima Points left, any Check you fail is automatically treated as if you had rolled a 1 on both dice and triggered a fumble (this means the Check cannot be rerolled and you immediately gain 1 Fabula Point). 

>If the rival has no Ultima Points but escalates into becoming a Villain of greater strength, they immediately recharge their Ultima Points: thus, the penalty described above will still apply. The only way to get rid of it is for your rival to die or to stop being a Villain.
#### Robot 
==High Fantasy and Natural Fantasy and Techno Fantasy==

>You are an artificial body animated through science or magic. Do you know who created you, and why? Is your existence a threat to someone? Are there any “copies” of you around the world? Were you always a robot, or do you still hold memories of a previous existence? 

You are not considered a living creature and gain Immunity to poison damage and Resistance to earth damage. You are also immune to the poisoned status effect. 

You do not need to breathe, eat or drink, but you still follow the normal rules for resting. You also recover Hit Points and recover from status effects as normal. 

You gain a +2 bonus to all Checks you perform to examine or interact with machines, technology and constructs (except for Accuracy Checks and Magic Checks)
#### Ruinbringer 
==High Fantasy==

>You possess almost limitless power, but there is a price to it: you shall bring doom to this world. How do you know this? Strange visions, markings that appear on your body, or something else? What gives you hope to stop what’s coming? 

When you acquire this Quirk, say which ruin you are supposed to bring into the world: that ruin immediately becomes one of your world’s threats. 

>>Examples: the Demon Queen, the Great Comet, the God of Bloodshed. 

Until your ruin comes true, you cannot Sacrifice yourself (in fact, servants of the Ruin might even lend you a hand and free you from any imprisonments that would prevent you from fulfilling your role in their plans). 

When a rule or ability requires you to spend Hit Points, Mind Points, or Fabula Points, you may instead let your ruin advance to completely ignore that cost. You describe what dark omens manifest, and the GM receives an opportunity (page 41 of the Core Rulebook) that can be used to add complications after the current scene has ended. 

At the end of each session (approximately four hours of play), before assigning XP, roll 2d20. If you roll equal to or lower than your current character level, your ruin advances (it will always advance if you are level 40 or higher). 

When your ruin advances for the 9th time, you lose this Quirk and your ruin comes true, manifesting into the world as a supreme Villain (15 Ultima Points). However, you immediately gain a Heroic Skill from those available for your Classes (you may even choose a Heroic Skill whose requirements you do not satisfy, unless they include a Skill you don’t have). Steel yourself and face your destiny
#### Souls Entwined 
==High Fantasy==

>You made a magical deal with another character. You can now dwell inside their body and physically manifest if necessary. When and why did you strike this pact? Is it part of your people’s magical nature, or was it a desperate attempt to keep you alive? When did it first get you into trouble? 

When you acquire this Quirk, choose another Player Character to act as a host body for your soul. You both immediately create a Bond towards each other. This Bond has 1 emotion chosen from admiration, affection and loyalty. 

>>Make sure whoever controls the host character is okay with this and looks forward to exploring the unique nature of this Quirk with you. 

You and your host may communicate telepathically (you are considered “able to hear each other” for the sake of Skills and effects that require it). 

Outside conflict scenes, you may enter the body of your host or leave it to physically appear at their side whenever you want. If you are ever more than 1 travel day away from your host, you vanish and reappear at their side. During a conflict, you may enter or leave the host’s body at the start of your turn (doing so does not require an action). 

While you are within the host’s body, you cannot perceive the outside world with your normal five senses nor physically interact with it, and the creatures outside cannot perceive you with their normal five senses nor physically interact with you. 

>However, anyone who can sense the presence of souls (through Rituals or similar supernatural abilities) will realize the host’s body contains two different souls. 

You cannot enjoy the benefits of a Rest unless your host rests as well.

When you Surrender, you immediately vanish and enter the host’s body (you may never be separated from the host as a consequence for Surrendering). 

When you host Surrenders, you immediately enter their body and cannot leave it until that character regains consciousness. 

When your host Sacrifices themselves, choose one option: 
* Survive: you immediately leave their body, lose this Quirk, your current Hit Points become equal to 0, and you Surrender. Then, you permanently increase your maximum Hit Points and maximum Mind Points by 10. 
* Final Farewell: you Sacrifice yourself in place of your host, who immediately recovers Hit Points equal to their Crisis score and no longer needs to Surrender or Sacrifice themselves.
#### Stolen Transport 
==Techno Fantasy

>You own a reliable transport that’s gotten you out of trouble quite a few times. Problem is, you kinda… borrowed it. What makes it unique? What kind of fuel does it run on? Who was the original owner, and why do they really want it back? 

You obtain a transport of your choice from among those found on page 125 of the Core Rulebook (such as a land vehicle, a ship, or even an airship) or you obtain a spaceship (see page 79). The size of this transport can be medium or large. It is enough to accommodate you and the rest of your group plus a dozen guests, and it is fitted with armaments that allow for vehicle combat (see page 65). 

Once per session (approximately four hours of play), the Game Master can give you 2 Fabula Points to introduce a narrative complication related to the nature of the transport or its original owner. However, the transport can never be destroyed without your permission.
#### Stubborn Scion 
==Natural Fantasy==

>You hail from the wealthiest, most influential family in this region. On what do they base their fortune and reputation? Are you the only heir? What is it about your family you really can’t stand, and why did it lead you to join the other characters? 

If you choose this Quirk during character creation, increase your initial savings (see Core Rulebook, page 165) by 1000 zenit. 

Additionally, you are accompanied by two fiercely loyal bodyguards: give them a name and describe their appearance. They do not have an NPC profile and never take part in Checks or conflicts, but you are inseparable and they somehow appear whenever you need their help. They offer the following benefits: 
* Be careful! When you suffer damage, you may halve it. 
* Here is the information you previously requested. During a Rest, you may ask the Game Master one question; they will answer truthfully. 
* Stay down, I’ll take care of this! When you create an elemental shard, you may have it deal extra damage equal to 【5 + half your level】. 

Whenever you make use of one of these benefits, your bodyguards suffer 1d6 Fatigue Points; as long as they have 10 or more Fatigue Points, you cannot rely on them. 

>>Fatigue is shared between bodyguards; it is not tracked individually. 

At the end of each session (approximately four hours of play), your bodyguards recover from 1d6 Fatigue Points (to a minimum of zero).
#### Survivor 
==Natural Fantasy and Techno Fantasy==

>You are among the few who survived a natural catastrophe or the attack of a dreadful creature. Do you believe someone is responsible for this? Were you able to keep in contact with any other survivors? Do you think reconstruction is possible? 

Permanently increase your maximum Hit Points and maximum Mind Points by 5. 

Choose one option: gain the ability to equip martial melee and ranged weapons, martial armor, and martial shields; or learn any one spell from the Elementalist or Spiritist lists; or permanently increase your maximum Inventory Points by 2.
#### The Beast who Spoke 
==Natural Fantasy and Techno Fantasy==

You belong to a long line of magical beasts who protected human villages over the centuries; nowadays, however, humanity has forgotten your role. Where do you make your nest? Do you know of any of your kind who are still alive? Who, among the other Player Characters, has shown interest or respect towards your nature? 

You may not equip any items, with the exception of accessories and weapon and armor modules (see Pilot Class, page 158 of the Techno Fantasy Atlas). However, as long as your armor slot is empty, you gain a +2 bonus to Defense and a +2 bonus to Magic Defense. 

You also gain two benefits of your choice among the following: 
* You may also equip custom weapons (see page 112 for more). 
* You learn one NPC spell (pages 310-311 of the Core Rulebook; you cannot choose the spell Devastation; if a Magic Check is required, use 【MIG + WLP】): customize the spell as needed (name, damage type, status effects etc.). 
* Your attacks with unarmed strikes deal 6 extra damage. This amount increases to 10 extra damage if you are level 30 or higher.
#### The Long Dream 
==Natural Fantasy==

>Long ago, your spirit dwelled in nature; then, something brought you to take on a human form, but it won’t be forever. Was it a prayer or some kind of magic? What part of your appearance betrays your origin? Do you fear that last farewell? 

At the end of each session (approximately four hours of play), before assigning XP, roll 2d20. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your current character level, the last farewell approaches. 

When a rule or ability requires you to spend Hit Points, Mind Points, or Fabula Points, you may instead ignore that cost. If you do, the last farewell approaches. 

At the end of a scene where you ignored a cost as described above, if the last farewell has approached at least 10 times already, the moment has come for you to leave the world of humans. You shall forever return to your original form as a natural and inanimate object: together with your group, take your time to roleplay one last bittersweet moment before you go. The same happens if you Sacrifice yourself. 

>>Examples: you might turn into a great guardian tree, into a visage on the side of a cliff, into a uniquely shaped rock, or into the brightest star in the sky. 

A character whose last farewell has come is considered dead in game terms, and cannot be brought back. However, from now on all Player Characters in the campaign (including your new character) will receive 1 additional Fabula Point at the start of each session (approximately four hours of play)
#### Traveling Workshop 
==Natural Fantasy==

>You own a transport that also acts as your shop and laboratory. How did you obtain it? How does it move, and what energy fuels it? What makes it extremely recognizable? Normally, how do people react to its passage? 

You may only choose this Quirk if your character has acquired one or more Classes among Gourmet (see page 148) and Tinkerer (see Core Rulebook, page 210). 

You obtain a land vehicle (see Core Rulebook, page 125). This vehicle is big enough to accommodate you and the rest of your group, plus two or three guests, but unfit for combat. 

If a Project requires a special ingredient or material, you may spend 1 Fabula Point to suddenly stumble upon something similar in your workshop; if you do, the invention must have a terrible flaw (see Core Rulebook, page 134)
#### Underchild 
==Natural Fantasy==

>There isn’t much you remember about your past, but upon awakening you found yourself in the depths. Once you reached the surface, you realized you weren’t exactly like everyone else... you are spontaneously attuned to ancient technology, and boast a strange power reserve you can draw from. Who was the first person you encountered? What items did you have with you? Are you afraid of regaining your memories? 

When a rule or ability requires you to spend 100 or fewer Hit Points, Mind Points, or Inventory Points during a conflict, you may instead ignore that cost. If you do, you cannot ignore a cost this way again until the end of your next Rest. Describe where this intense but ephemeral energy stems from!

>>Examples: a magic gem hidden in your left eye; a power generator grafted to your arm; an arcane circuit that resembles an intricate tattoo. 

Additionally, when you encounter a contraption or creature connected to ancient technology or to a ruins’ past, you may choose one option: ask the Game Master its purpose; or ask the Game Master what can activate it; or ask the Game Master what can deactivate it. The Game Master answers truthfully and you describe a brief flashback that reveals the answer. 

After you receive an answer this way for the sixth time, you remember the real reason why you had been left dormant underground, and the Game Master chooses one option: you remember a key clue regarding a threat that is present in your world; or you remember the existence of a new threat and receive a key clue about it. 

>Note that you will keep all benefits from this Quirk after this revelation (both the ability to ignore costs and to ask questions).
#### Xiphosymbiosis 
==Techno Fantasy==

>Your ability to manifest a physical body is tied to a weapon, which must be wielded by another person. How were you created? Do many like you exist? Is this your first wielder? Who did you refuse to join forces with? Do you crave freedom? 

When you acquire this Quirk, choose another Player Character to act as your wielder. You both immediately create a Bond towards each other, which has 1 emotion chosen from among admiration, inferiority, loyalty, and mistrust. 

>>Make sure the Player controlling the wielder is okay with this relationship and looks forward to exploring the unique nature of this Quirk with you. 

Together with the rest of your group, create your core: a rare custom weapon (see page 115) worth 1200 zenit or less. The core cannot be lost, stolen or destroyed by external means, but automatically disintegrates if you Sacrifice yourself. It is never considered martial (E) and anyone can equip it. A character who has it equipped may perform the Skill action to change its Accuracy Check’s Attributes into any combination of two different Attributes (apply the change to both forms if it is a transforming weapon). 

>>As long as you have this Quirk, only your wielder may equip your core. 

Your current Hit Points may never go below 1– any excess loss of Hit Points is instead suffered by your wielder (this happens regardless of distance). When your wielder Surrenders, you immediately vanish, retreating within the core (regardless of distance) and becoming dormant; you cannot exit until the wielder regains consciousness. The Game Master may choose to impose the consequences of such a Surrender on you or on your wielder. 

When your wielder Sacrifices themselves, choose one option: 
* Awakening (only if your Bonds have total strength 8 or higher). You lose this Quirk and your core appears in your hands. You immediately perform the Equipment action for free and equip it on yourself. 
* Legacy (only if another willing PC you can see is present on the scene). That Player Character becomes your new wielder and your core appears inside their backpack. 
* Shatter. You Sacrifice yourself in place of the wielder, who immediately recovers Hit Points equal to their Crisis score and no longer needs to Surrender or Sacrifice. 

 Whenever you gain a level, if your Bonds have a total strength of 10

#### Stubborn Skeptic
> This tale of monsters, demons, and magicks sounds like videogame nonsense. You're probably dreaming, or someone hypnotized you. Maybe it's a prank! Surely it won't turn out you're a wandering soul from Purgatory, or that you stumbled into a magical portal. You gotta admit though, your memories are a fair bit jumbled.

If you are about to receive the effects of an attack, a spell, a Skill, or any other game effect controlled by another creature (be it a beneficial effect, or a negative effect), you must roll 1d6:
* 1-4: the effects apply as normal, and you gain 1 Suspicion Point.
* 5-6: you disbelieve the effects, and thus do not receive them.
At the end of each session (approximately four hours of play), before assigning XP, roll 2d20. If you roll equal to or lower than your current character level, you gain 1 Suspicion Point. Then, if you have 20 or more Suspicion Points, you remember how you arrived here and the Game Master chooses one option: you remember a key clue regarding a threat that is present in your world; or you remember the existence of a new threat and receive a key clue about it. 

When you regain your memories, a strange power awakens within you: you lose this Quirk and receive a Heroic Skill of your choice (you may even choose a Heroic Skill whose requirements you do not satisfy, unless they include a Skill you don't have). This includes choosing a Heroic Skill for a Class you do not have.

#### (Un)faithful Servant
> You are the right arm to another character, someone who could be destined to great things but is in dire need of your help, as well as showing a frequent lack of common sense. Which promise, debt, or oath binds you? What is your disposition towards them? What do you think is their most significant flaw? Have you ever thought you might be the one who deserves that spot? What secret have you kept from them?

When you gain this Quirk, choose another Player Character: that character becomes your liege. You both create a Bond towards each other; your Bond has one emotion chosen between loyalty and mistrust, and your liege's Bond towards you has one emotion chosen among admiration, inferiority, or mistrust.

> Make sure whoever controls your liege agrees to this relationship and is looking forward to exploring the unique nature of this Quirk with you.

When your liege performs a Check, if you are present on the scene, you may offer your help: you will use the rules for Group Checks (Core Rulebook, page 50), but you automatically succeed on your Support Check. If this happens during a conflict scene, you do not lose your turn in the current round (thus ignoring the limitations in the rules for Teamwork, on page 76 of the Core Rulebook).

Whenever your liege accepts your help in a Group Check, you gain 1 Reliance Points.

At the end of each session (approximately four hours of play), before assigning XP, roll 2d20. If you roll equal to or lower than your current character level, you gain 1 Reliance Point. Then, if you have 20 or more Reliance Points, choose one of the following options:
* Challenge: it is now time to put your liege to the test. Together with the Player who controls the liege, narrate a duel, a challenge or similar competition in which your liege must prove they do not need your help, and they succeed. Then, you lose this Quirk and gain a Heroic Skill of your choice (you may even choose a Heroic Skill whose requirements you do not satisfy, unless they include a Skill you don't have).
* Betrayal: the hour is dark, and you show your true colors. Together with the Player who controls your liege, narrate your betrayal and agree on an appropriate consequence (such as the loss of an important object, the resurrection of a terrifying foe, or a change of Theme for your liege). Then, your Player Character becomes a minor or Major Villain (Game Master's choice) and you create a new character.
