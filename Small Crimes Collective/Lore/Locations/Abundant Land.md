The rich in nutrient soil of the island comes from its volcanic origins, a dormant volcano located just off of the sea cliff on the south side of the island. It was originally uninhabited when the single ruler of the city's origin came across it, though there are evidences of a much older ancient civilization buried under the volcanic ash.
