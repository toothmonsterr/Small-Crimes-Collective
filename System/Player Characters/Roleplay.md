Playing the game in Small Crimes Collective is done primarily through either **roleplay** or [[Playing in Sessions|sessions]], which are differentiated by whether or not there is a GM present. Roleplay is done with any number of players (you can even roleplay with yourself, if you want), usually through text, and without someone "in charge" of the scene beyond the people within it. 
## Roleplay Etiquette
1. Consent is #1. Do not tread on another player's character autonomy without permission -- for example, don't initiate a conflict without discussing it out-of-character beforehand.
2. Cooperation is key. When playing the game, pay attention to what everybody else is saying and encourage everyone to play an active role.
3. Use threads and content warnings for scenes that could contain heavier content, or any content on the lines & veils list.
4. Avoid meta-gaming. Your character should operate under knowledge they know in-character.
5. Write as clearly and legibly as you can for the accessibility of other players.
6. If someone is uncomfortable or not having a desirable time, stop. Discuss what can be resolved together, or ping a moderator if needed.
## Fabula Points in RP
Fabula Points can be spent in roleplay scenes with the following restrictions in addition to their normal rules:
* You cannot gain Fabula Points by fumbling a roll.
* You cannot gain XP by spending Fabula Points.
* If you receive a mechanical benefit from spending a Fabula Point (ex. Hundred Faces quirk), this benefit will **not** carry over into your next session.
* Altering the story via Fabula Points is allowed, but any altercation to the narrative **must** be approved by the rest of the players in the scene. If another player has a lore-based reason to disagree, the suggestion is vetoed.
