## Materials
Crafting equipment can be done with **materials**, which can be gained through session rewards, events, and downtime foraging. Each material come assigned with one or more **tags**, which correlate to the qualities you are able to craft into your equipment. Each tag is associated with a symbol.

> [!info] Example
> A **Smoldering Rock** gained from the volcanic ashes of the isle would perhaps have a 🔥 `fire` tag or a 👊`tough` tag, which you could use to give the `Restistance: Fire` quality to an accessory.

Materials are situational, and will often be developed by a GM based on what makes sense for a session. For example, a session where the party fights a leviathan may provide a **Water-Logged Scale** `💀dark` `🌠mythic`.

GMs are also able to roll on the [[#Material Generation]] tables when deciding on their session rewards.

Each tag is associated with either an **effect**, **element**, or **rarity**. 
* Effects are tags that are associated with mechanical changes, ex. `🔺sharp` adding additional damage to a weapon. Materials should always have one of these tags.
* Elements are tags associated with a damage type, ex. `⚡bolt`. These elements can also be correlated to a status effect, Dazed in the case of `⚡bolt`. A material lacking one of these tags is considered unattuned.
* Rarity tags are associated with the [[Player Progression#Player Tiers|player tier]] they are attributed to, such as `🌀strange` representing the second tier, levels 10-19. A material lacking one of these tags is considered **common** or otherwise basic.

These categories can be mixed and matched, but a single material can never have more than one tag from each category. 

> [!info] Example
> A **Mysterious Orb** can be `🔮arcane` + `🚦light` + `🌠mythic`, but it **cannot** be both `🪽pure` and `🔮arcane` effects. Similarly, the material **cannot** have both `🚦light` and `💀dark`, only one or the other element.

### Material Generation
These tables are to facilitate the creation of materials in leu of developing them ad-hoc. For example, rolling on a creature table based on the type(s) of creature(s) fought will provide you with a unique material related to the session.
