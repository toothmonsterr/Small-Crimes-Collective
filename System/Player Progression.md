Progression in Small Crimes Collective is done through collection of experience points (XP). XP points can be gained through a number of ways, described below. Characters can spend their accumulated XP on a variety of things, including leveling up.

There are a few primary ways to gain XP. The main ways are:
* Playing in a session gains **+5 XP**, with an additional +5 XP for every two hours past the first four. For example, a 6 hour quest will grand +10 XP, and an 8 hour quest will grant +15 XP.
* Spending Fabula Points (FP) gains **+1 XP** per FP spent.
* A villain spending Ultima Points (UP) gains **+1 XP** per UP spent.
* Invoking a [[Hooks|hook]] in a roleplay scene gains **+1 XP** per participant, once per scene.
* Achieving specific server-wide roleplay objectives.

Players can spend their XP to level up, primarily. Each level requires **10 XP**. When you level up your character, note it in [character-log](https://discord.com/channels/1382793642871099392/1392976635195818164) with the following format:
`[Character] levels up: [X] --> [Y]`

Games may be limited to specific tiers of play, based on a range of character levels, meaning every member in the party is expected to fall within the specified range. The existing tiers are:
* ğŸŸ¢ Tier 1 - levels **5-9**
* ğŸŸ¡ Tier 2 - levels **10-19**
* ğŸ”´ Tier 3 - levels **20-29**
