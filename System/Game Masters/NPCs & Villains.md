Non-player characters (NPCs) are any characters that influences the story that are not [[Character Creation|player characters]]. NPCs can range from a background character in a roleplay scene to a major villain in an overarching plot. There are three categories of NPCs: **Background**, **Allied**, and **Villain.**
### Background Characters
Any player can make a **background** NPC. These are established through play -- characters who exist to facilitate a set scene, or NPCs from a character's established narrative.

> [!info] Example
> Background NPCs are simple to establish -- a bartender in a scene that takes the orders of the players is one example, as well as any number of character-specific family members, friends, or other smaller-scale relationships.
### Allies
**Allies** are reoccurring NPCs in military, government, or [[Factions|established factions]] that are generally cooperative and helpful towards the player characters and their goals. These NPCs can be created by any [[Roleplay#GM Rules|GM]].

> [!info] Example
>  Allied NPCs can be considered **passive** -- they exist to further plot in convenient ways, ex. a political figure giving a group of players a specific request as the basis of a session, or a representative of a faction who exposits on said faction.

Allies do not need to have [[NPCs & Villains#Profiles|profiles]]. There are a few ways to apply allied NPCs to checks when in leu of a profile:
* **NPCs as Check Bonuses** -- While present on the scene, an NPC – or group of NPCs – grants a +2 bonus to any Check they could reasonably help out with. During a conflict, this bonus should be available only once per round.
* **NPCS as Special Abilities** -- NPC has one or more special abilities. These special abilities can be passive effects with an ongoing duration, or active or reactive effects that can be used a limited number of times per conflict (two or three uses is a good rule of thumb). Allied NPCs handled this way **do not** have an independent turn during the round, and thus do not count as Player Characters when establishing the number of enemy turns in the conflict.
### Villains
**Villains** are reoccurring NPCs that have specified **goals** they are working towards. Villains do **not** need to be explicitly morally compromised, and the general specification is any NPC furthering a hook, plotline, or threat single-handedly. Villains are able to be created by any GM after they've established a [[Hooks|hook]] relevant to the villain's goal.

Villains are to have dimensions to them relevant to the world. It is recommended you attach your villain to a hook, an existing [[Factions|faction]], or any existing [[threats]]. As you establish them further, your villain's goals may form these hooks, factions, or threats in their own right.

Villain rules are as follows:
1. Villains must have statistics in the form of a visible [[NPCs & Villains#Profiles|profile]].
2. Villains must have an actionable **goal**. These goals should be specific and actionable in ways player characters are able to subvert. These can (and should) be tied to clocks that are visible to the players in their play.
3. Villains must have a planned arc. You should have a general idea of where the villain's story goes, even if you have multiple directions it could go in. You need to plant to use a villain in a **minimum of 3 sessions** for them to count as reoccurring.
4. Try not to overlap -- don't step on others' toes if there is already a villain doing the thing you want your villain to do, or try to reconceptualize the concept to differentiate it.
5. Villains must be documented. They can be logged in the [npc-profiles](https://discord.com/channels/1382793642871099392/1394808243704037436) channel and should follow the template pinned. Create a thread off of their profile post and use it to log any appearances, plot developments, and clocks.
## Profiles
When established NPCs need their own statistics and abilities, they can be created with a profile. NPC profiles can be created using the rules in the Core Rulebook (page 302) with the following changes:
* Skills cannot come from [[Character Creation|Character]] classes, and must be picked from the list.
* The Use Equipment Skill no longer exists. Humanoids have 4 free initial Skills, just like Monsters.

You can use [Fultimator](https://fabula-ultima-helper.web.app/) to create NPCs using these rules as well. If you design an NPC in this way, provide a link or the JSON data for others to use.
