When [[Anatoly, the First Begotten]] finally died, an era of loss entered the souls of the city. The likeness of the immortal man litter the island, sculptures and statues across almost every park or public space depicting Anatoly. Recently, vandals have begun defacing his likeness... Statues have been found with smashed-in faces, pitch-black paint splattered across them, and some statues being found entirely missing.
