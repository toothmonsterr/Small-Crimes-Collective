Fishermen and divers in general were among the most disadvantaged people during the [[Angelic Night]], as deaths at the sea were hard for even the Angelic Nights to defend against.

The Pearl Riots started when said fishermen made strikes against their employers, demanding better protections and better pay. Different workers from other industries soon joined them, each with their own grievances against the system, and soon an all out riot broke when corporations tried to suppress their demands by force, resulting in a conflict that destroyed the [[The Gray Route]] and turned it into what it is now.
