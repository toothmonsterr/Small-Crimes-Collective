Lore Points (or LP) are the currency for the reward system for [[Game Masters]], lore writers, and any other administrative tasks within or beyond the standard game master's role. LP is most often spent on narrative progression-- such as leveling up villains, establishing factions and threats, and progressing world clocks.

The exchange options for spending your LP are below.

| LP Cost | Option | Description |

### Villain Management
Villains require having an available **villain slot.** Each GM starts with **one** villain slot they can use to introduce a **Minor** villain. This minor villain can be leveled up into a Major & Supreme villain, but you cannot make a Major or Supreme villain without spending the LP to introduce them as such.
