Qualities are used in [[Crafting#Rare Equipment|rare equipment crafting]]. A piece of equipment may only have **one** quality, regardless of rarity.

As well, when a character has qualities on equipment with the same name or effect, their effects will never stack or combine. This rule effects the following:
- Variants of the same quality, such as Resistance (Fire) and Resistance (Cold) will not combine **unless** they are listed specifically as separate qualities, ex. ;
- Multiple qualities that increase Defense or Magic Defense will never stack;
- Multiple qualities that give extra damage may never affect the same instance of damage;
- Multiple qualities that increase the recovery of Hit Points, Mind Points or Inventory Points will never stack;
- Multiple Qualities that increase bonuses for Accuracy Checks or Magic Checks may never affect the same check.
- Multiple Qualities that halve or multiply the same value (such as the MP cost of a spell). For example, a spell could not benefit from the Memorize and Momentum Thief qualities to quarter its total MP cost.
## Approved Qualities
The following table has all the approved qualities you may add to your rare equipment. More may be added in the future.
