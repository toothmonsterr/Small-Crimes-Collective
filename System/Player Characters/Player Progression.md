Progression in Small Crimes Collective is done through collection of experience points (XP). XP points can be gained through a number of ways, described below. Characters can spend their accumulated XP on a variety of things, including leveling up.
## Gaining XP
There are a few primary ways to gain XP. The main ways are:
* Playing in a session gains **+5 XP**, with an additional +1 XP for every hour past the first four. For example, a 6 hour quest will grand +7 XP, and an 8 hour quest will grant +9 XP.
* Spending Fabula Points (FP) in sessions gains XP for every point spent in a session, divided by the number of players.
* A villain spending Ultima Points (UP) gains **+1 XP** per UP spent.
* Writing a [[Playing in Sessions#Player Logs|Player Log]] gains **+1 XP** per session logged.
* Invoking a [[Hooks|hook]] in a roleplay scene gains **+1 XP** per participant, once per scene.
* Achieving specific server-wide roleplay objectives.
## Spending XP
Players can spend their XP to level up, primarily. Each level requires **10 XP**. When you level up your character, note it in [character-log](https://discord.com/channels/1382793642871099392/1392976635195818164) with the following format:
`[Character] levels up: [X] --> [Y]`

Remember you are able to change your character's Theme and Identity when gaining a Level. This should be documented on the form.
## Player Tiers
Games may be limited to specific tiers of play, based on a range of total character levels, meaning every member in the party is expected to fall within the specified range. The existing tiers are:
* ğŸŸ¢ Tier 1 - levels **5-9**
* ğŸŸ¡ Tier 2 - levels **10-19**
* ğŸ”´ Tier 3 - levels **20-29**
* ğŸ”µ Tier 4 - levels **30+**
