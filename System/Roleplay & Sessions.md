Playing the game in Small Crimes Collective is done primarily through either **roleplay** or **sessions**, which are differentiated by whether or not there is a GM present. **Roleplay** is done with any number of players (you can even roleplay with yourself, if you want), usually through text, and without someone "in charge" of the scene beyond the people within it. **Sessions** are done with a GM running the game, usually with a larger amount of players, and at a specific time with all players present.
## Roleplay Etiquette
1. Consent is #1. Do not tread on another player's character autonomy without permission -- for example, don't initiate a conflict without discussing it out-of-character beforehand.
2. Cooperation is key. When playing the game, pay attention to what everybody else is saying and encourage everyone to play an active role.
3. Use threads and content warnings for scenes that could contain heavier content, or any content on the lines & veils list.
4. Avoid meta-gaming. Your character should operate under knowledge they know in-character.
5. Write as clearly and legibly as you can for the accessibility of other players.
6. If someone is uncomfortable or not having a desirable time, stop. Discuss what can be resolved together, or ping a moderator if needed.
## Character Profiles
TBD.
## Session Rules
1. Sessions are announced by GMs in the scheduling channel. Sessions should have a time listed, an expected duration, a title, and a short description.
2. It is up to the GM which players they choose to play.
3. There are no prerequisites to being a GM. Just react to the below post and you can run your own games!
