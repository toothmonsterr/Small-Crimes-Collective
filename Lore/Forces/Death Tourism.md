Perhaps the most controversial business in the city, Death Tourism has become a contemptible but very present part of the city's economy.

Death Tourists arrive to the city to pull all the things that death doesn't allow them to elsewhere, starting from stunts so extreme that they would be fatal elsewhere, and only getting more bizarre from there.

Doctors Within Borders are always exasperated with them, Agents of Chaos and SpannerWork gladly exploit them, and the Church is torn between those who want preach the words of Anatoly to them, and those who decry their reckless actions as making fun of the gift of life.
