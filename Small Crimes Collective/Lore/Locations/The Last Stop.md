Due to the fact that [[ghosts]] exist in the city, many people grew fearful that their bodies would be commandeered against their will, after they die. Thus arose the tradition of burning the dead, to ensure that they will be forever restful, and the crematoriums that ensure this fact are all gathered at the Last Stop district.

People outside of the city are first disturbed, but upon explanation, they reluctantly admit that it is the rational response to an irrational fear.
