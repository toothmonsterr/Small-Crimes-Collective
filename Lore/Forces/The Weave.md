The Weave isn't [[magic]], precisely. Rather, it is the raw material from which magic is woven, not entirely unlike how a collection of threads is shaped and formed into a garment. It is the fabric on which magic is drawn.

Some people have easier access to it than most, but the vast majority need to rely on [[Conduit|conduits]] to access the Weave, and thus channel magic for their use.
