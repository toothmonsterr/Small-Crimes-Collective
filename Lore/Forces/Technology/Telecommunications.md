Shortwave radio signals are notoriously unreliable in the city. The science as to why is still ongoing: maybe it’s an ongoing side effect of the Angel Phenomena, some sort of lingering field from an ancient Spiral Civilization device, or (per one hand-written manifesto circulated at a street corner) a concerted effort by the city’s telephone company to maintain their effective monopoly.

The city has adapted — hardened underground cables link pay phones and land lines throughout the city.
