The traveling pirate ship of Ontus the Brave arrived with a massive amount of cavalry and prisoner-workers alike, the aforementioned captain looking for somewhere to retire and flaunt his collected wealth with. Thus he formed the city, at a center point of where the main river splits into a delta, where he built a protected castle with the labor of the people he had collected chains around.

Ontus was a harsh ruler with a tendency to execute dissidents. Thus came the First Death of Anatoly the Begotten-- an embarrassment to the king ruler, he funded the study of Anatoly's odd immortality until the man finally died, at which point the Angelic Nights began. He died soon after, assassinated by an unknown force.
