[[Anatoly, the First Begotten|Anatoly]] is brought in front of [[Ontus the Brave|King Ontus]], forced to kneel in front of him, after his slave revolt is suppressed. The King gloats of his victory, and orders his soldiers to shoot Anatoly to death.

They shoot him once, and he falls to the floor... only to raise his head back again, a few seconds after.
