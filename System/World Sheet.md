## The World of [[Enigmata]]
This world's structure is a broken up pangea of large isles atop a mass of ocean. Speckled volcanic isles exist outside the main pangea, including the isle of [[Twin Star Falls]], where our story takes place.

## Technology & Magic
Technology and Magic exist hand-in-hand in the world of Enigmata-- one does not exist without the other. Technology acts a tool to use magic-- [[Electricity|electricity]] comes from harnessing the [[The Weave|weave]] as much as it comes from copper [[Conduit|conduits]].

Magic is classified as anything innate to the world's power-- for example, the wellsprings of energy from ley lines, rivers, and forests. Technology, conversely, is anything that wields those wellsprings through constructed tools and mechanics. Examples range from a well of water that never runs dry, to a pistol or airplane that sparks off of innate magic surges in the weave of the atmosphere.

Magic is rarely, if ever, fantastical. There is little to no concept of wizards or witches-- instead, you'll often find artificers and magitech engineers as average, every-day citizens. Utilizing magic almost always involves the use of technology, and rarely is it possible to innately wield magic without some form of technological conduit.

Technology, in contrast, has not progressed particularly linearly to our own world. Tools and structures are mostly equivalent to a post-industrial era, but due to the utilization of natural magic, issues such as pollution are less of a concern. Weave is not likely to stain the world it comes from, so even grand wars against technologically advanced nation will mostly maintain the environment of the land it takes place on.

The miracle of Twin Star Falls is an oddity by contrast. Oddities are strange occurrences that cannot be explained by magic or utilized by technology. The world is filled with these oddities-- leviathans of the far ocean, the nature of the moon, and the end of the world are all oddities that impact the world but cannot be explained.

## Historical Events
Most of the historical timeline is focused on that of Twin Star Falls. Feel free to expand on the wider world history as a community!
### The First Begotten
The Chronicle begins with [[Anatoly, the First Begotten|Anatoly]]; an unlucky criminal on death row. At his execution, it’s discovered that Anatoly... can’t die.

For much of the rest of his life, he’s a subject of notoriety and intense research. Near the end of his life, he’s able to escape his life sentence as a test subject, and finally dies of old age.
### Nightfall
Once he passes, the [[Angelic Night|Angelic Nights]] begin. The kiss of life; where every being in the city is immortal while the sun hides away. The Nights seem random at first until a tinkerer [[Spanner, Inventor of the Light|Spanner]] is able to create a system to predict the Nights will fall.

Now that the phenomena can be predicted, people begin to put it to use – it’s a time for [[Doctors Within Borders|dangerous surgeries]], [[Death Tourism|reckless entertainment]]... and the time for dangerous criminals to act with abandon.
### Present: Death Tourism 
Soon, outsiders begin to flock to the city seeking to do all of the dangerous things that would kill you elsewhere. Among them is one [[Leonid Yakovich]], who becomes a prominent member of the underworld.

The flood of impulsive tourists leads to a surge in crime, and the city reacts. Groups of [[Agents of Chaos|bounty hunters]] form to capture and execute people outside of the city limits during the Angelic Nights, though they’re hardly innocent groups themselves.

* Much of the ocean is unexplored due to its massive stretch across the far horizon. Is there something on the other side?
* How did [[Anatoly, the First Begotten|Anatoly]] come back to life? Why do his eyes persist in the city? Why does the phenomenon only happen on the island, in the City of Angels?
## Threats
* The lessening reliability of [[The Light]] has resulted in some amount of accidental (and permanent) deaths. Did the corporation know this would happen? Is it fixable? How will this impact the City of Angels?
* [[Ontus the Brave|Ontus]] left a legacy. There exists areas he conquered and left behind-- what happened to these countries and nations? Do they hold a grudge?
* The far ocean is filled with massive creatures that can snatch a whole warship out of the water. Reports have shown evidence their habitat is getting closer to the pangea...
