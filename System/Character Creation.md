Creating a character in Small Crimes Collective involves developing a character in Fabula Ultima and submitting it through a process of approval in order to make sure all the pieces fit into existing lore, and that any new lore you add can be properly documented.

## Character Requirements
* Your character must use the [[Fabula Ultima#Approved Content|approved content]] of the server.
* Your character cannot have elements that are listed on our [lines and veils](https://safety.vercel.app/wguzTmQKSfR3XFi-FicRF).
* Your character must be from the world we are creating together. We are collaboratively worldbuilding this setting together, so if you can't find somewhere that fits, feel free to pitch a concept to the server or in your submission.
* Your character must be of age/an adult.
* Your character must be original and not of an existing property.
* Your character must be generally able to fit into a collaborative play setting with other player characters.
## Character Sheets
Players have two options for character sheets:
* Duplicate this [template gsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gRVfD8eeljeorSeOnhEntdsz0aasU7QXAELid90equg/edit#gid=0) and create your character following the guide.
* Create a [Fultimator](https://fabula-ultima-helper.web.app/) account and create your character within the builder tool.

You will submit your character using either of these two tools.
## Creation Process
Character creation largely follows the core rulebook, but is outlined here for clarity.
### Step 1: Traits
To start creating your character, you'll need to develop their **Traits**. These are the core pillars of your character's narrative. Think of them less as constraints to write within and more tools to wield when it makes sense.

Traits are in three categories:
* **Identity** - A short description of your character concept, ex. "The First Begotten".
* **Theme** - A strong ideal, emotion, or lens in which your character operates, ex. "Justice."
* **Origin** - Where your character is from in the world.

If you need help developing any of these, let the community know in the [character-help channel](https://discord.com/channels/1382793642871099392/1382793644167401512). You are free to develop regions, cities, and locales outside [[Twin Star Falls|The City]] for your character to be from, based on the landmasses on the [[Enigmata]].
### Step 2: Classes
Choose two OR three (not more or fewer) classes to start with. You have five levels to input into these classes. Note down the **Free Benefits** and **Skills** gained from each class you take.
### Step 3: Attributes
Set your core attributes with one of the following spreads. 
- **Jack of All Trades**: d8 / d8 / d8 / d8
- **Average**: d10 / d8 / d8 / d6
- **Specialized**: d10 / d10 / d6 / d6

Assign these dice to your **Dexterity (DEX)**, **Insight (INS)**, **Might (MIG)**, and **Willpower (WLP)**.
### Step 5: Starting Equipment
You can spend up to 500 zenit in the [[Basic Equipment Shop]]. You keep the zenit left over and will roll for how much additional you start with in the next step. Shop documents are to come.
#### Optional: Custom Weapons
A custom weapon can be created during character creation with the following rules:
* It belongs to one Category of your choice (arcane, bow, brawling, dagger, firearm, flail, heavy, spear, sword or thrown).
* It is not a martial weapon (✦), but might become one depending on the customizations that are chosen for it (see below).
* It is a two-handed weapon and cannot benefit from the Monkey Grip Heroic Skill (see Core Rulebook, page 238); in short, a custom weapon will always occupy both hand slots.
* It is a melee weapon or a ranged weapon (your choice, and regardless of the Category you previously chose for it). 
* It has a cost of 300 zenit. 
* Its Accuracy Check relies on 【DEX + INS】 or 【DEX + MIG】 (your choice).
* It deals physical damage equal to 【HR + 5】.

A custom weapon also receives three customizations from the [[#Customizations|list below]].
* Each customization can only be chosen once for each custom weapon.
* Choosing a customization marked with ✦ turns the weapon into a martial weapon.
* If a customization says “you”, it refers to the character who has the weapon equipped. 
* Some especially powerful customizations count as two customizations or increase the cost of the custom weapon.

You must note that you are taking a custom weapon in your character submission, as well as noting the customizations you took for them.

If you wish to create a custom weapon *after* character creation, you will need to follow the rules for [[Craft & Trade|crafting and trading equipment]].

| When you perform the Attack action and choose to attack with this weapon, you may perform two attacks (against the same target or against different targets). If you do, both attacks follow the rules for two-weapon fighting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Transforming** *(increases the custom weapon’s cost by 100 zenit)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| This weapon has a second form, which must be designed as a separate custom weapon, must have the transforming customization, and doesn’t cost you any zenit. While you have one of the two forms equipped, you can equip the other form whenever you want. During a conflict scene, you can only do so during your turn, while no other effect is being resolved, and only once per turn. If one or both the forms are martial (✦), remember that you must have the appropriate Classes to equip them. Additionally, a transforming weapon can still only have one Quality (the Quality applies to both forms). |

### Step 4: Starting Zenit
To determine your starting Zenit, roll for it in the [rolls-log](https://discord.com/channels/1382793642871099392/1392976635195818164) channel. The roll needs to be marked by a character name or concept.

### Step 6: Finishing Touches
To round out your character, it's time to determine their **name**, **pronouns**, **appearance**, and **biography.** Name, pronoun, and a short biography is required for submission. If you want to use art for your character, keep in mind that we have a **no generative AI** rule on the server for artwork.
## Submission
Now it's time to submit your character. This is a collaborative process, so there may be some edits or suggestions made to allow your character to best fit into the world.

To start, create a post in the [character-profiles](https://discord.com/channels/1382793642871099392/1382793643974201573) channel with the following:

* Name -- the name or moniker of your character.
* Pronouns -- the character's pronouns of choice.
* Origin -- where the character is from, pre-established or of your own creation
* Classes -- the two to three classes you selected during creation
* Sheet -- a link to your Google sheet (make sure it's set to public) or Fultimator sheet 
* Weapon (optional) -- if you took a custom weapon and your customizations.
* About -- Some history/profile/descriptions of your character, as brief or as long as you'd like.
* Art (optional) -- any character art you may want to use as reference.

A GM will make a thread from your post to review it, discuss with you, and suggest changes as needed. These threads are public, and other players can view or make suggestions as well.

Once you're approved by a GM, you can begin to play! Head over to [[Roleplay & Sessions]] for more information.
