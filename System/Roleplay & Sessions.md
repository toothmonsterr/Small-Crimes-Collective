Playing the game in Small Crimes Collective is done primarily through either **roleplay** or **sessions**, which are differentiated by whether or not there is a GM present. 

**Roleplay** is done with any number of players (you can even roleplay with yourself, if you want), usually through text, and without someone "in charge" of the scene beyond the people within it. 

**Sessions** are done with a GM running the game, usually with a larger amount of players, and at a specific time with all players present.
## Roleplay Etiquette

![[roleplay-banner.png]]

1. Consent is #1. Do not tread on another player's character autonomy without permission -- for example, don't initiate a conflict without discussing it out-of-character beforehand.
2. Cooperation is key. When playing the game, pay attention to what everybody else is saying and encourage everyone to play an active role.
3. Use threads and content warnings for scenes that could contain heavier content, or any content on the lines & veils list.
4. Avoid meta-gaming. Your character should operate under knowledge they know in-character.
5. Write as clearly and legibly as you can for the accessibility of other players.
6. If someone is uncomfortable or not having a desirable time, stop. Discuss what can be resolved together, or ping a moderator if needed.

## Session Rules

![[session-banner.png]]

Sessions are announced by GMs in the scheduling channel. Sessions should have a time listed, an expected duration, a title, and a short description. Sessions will be listed as either Voice or Play-by-Post (PBP) and may have a player tier restriction for balancing. As well, if any specific players are requested, they should be mentioned along with their character. If a specific VTT is required, it will be listed, and players are expected to be able to use said VTT when playing.

Each session will be scheduled with an Apollo event that allows users to mark their availability. To submit your character to the session for selection by the GM, paste your character information in the thread using the following format:
```Name:
Pronouns:
Classes:
Total Level:
Sheet:
```

The rules for playing in a session are as follows:
1. Respect the GM and your fellow players. Communication is key. Regular server rules and roleplay rules are applicable.
2. Try to avoid playing in sessions when distracted. It can be disrespectful to your GM and fellow players to be multitasking when in a session. Sometimes it can't be helped, but still, prioritize the session and be clear with everyone when you may be distracted or AFK.
3. Every roll is visible, including the GM's. Use a dice bot like Avrae to make your rolls for everyone to see.
### Rewards
Sessions reward XP, with a bare minimum of +5 XP per session.
* Playing in a session gains **+5 XP**, with an additional +5 XP for every two hours past the first four. For example, a 6 hour quest will grand +10 XP, and an 8 hour quest will grant +15 XP.
* Spending Fabula Points (FP) gains **+1 XP** per FP spent.
* A villain spending Ultima Points (UP) gains **+1 XP** per UP spent.

As well, players will get a sum of zenit and a session-relevant [[material]]. The specific rewards per player are up to each GM and the session at hand, but we have recommended tables 

### Requesting Sessions
Any player can request a session for any GM to run. This can be as specific or as vague as you wish, but it's helpful for GM's to have a general idea of your expectations for the session so they can best plan for it.

To request a session, go to the [session-requests](https://discord.com/channels/1382793642871099392/1393336879352643676) channel. Use the following format and ping the GM role:
```
Desired Gameplay: [RP/Exploration/Combat/ETC]
Tier: [The tier of the character you hope to play]
Desired Time: [Use a hammertime code for this]
Desired Format: [VC/PBP and/or TotM/VTT]

## GM Rules

![[GM-banner.png]]

There are only a few prerequisites to being a GM:
1. An approved character
2. **Either** a general understanding of the game's mechanics **or** a willingness to learn them.
3. A willingness to work within established lore & an eagerness to develop more.

In terms of responsibilities, GM's are to run games whenever they are comfortable and able to. There is no requirement for GMing a minimum amount, just a willingness to collaborate and develop stories for others when possible.

Otherwise, the rules are as follows:
1. Cooperate with your players and pay attention to what everybody else is saying. Encourage everyone to play an active role-- each participant should get their time in the spotlight.
2. Play by the rules & play fairly. If you think one or more elements should be altered, discuss the matter with everyone else. Only change those elements if the entire group has agreed on how to do so.
3. Ask questions. Move the action forward by asking questions to everyone else. Propose things before they happen-- but leave the question open ended so players can expand on it as needed.
4. Play to find out what happens & avoid over-planning. Fabula Ultima is a game that embraces open-ended narratives and collaborative storytelling. Try not to railroad your players without good cause.
5. Make good use of villains. Use preexisting ones from the server's villain list, or make your own. Establish their identity and expand on them to further the story of the server as a whole.
6. Document your session's rewards as well as the session's start and end times. These can be posted in the[ session-log](https://discord.com/channels/1382793642871099392/1393344882839654562) channel using the pinned template. Rewards are ultimately up to you to determine, but we offer recommended rewards and roll tables as guidelines.
7. Record your [[Hooks|hooks]]. Hooks are things that come up in roleplay, sessions, or events that are currently unresolved but can be followed up on outside of the current session. These should be impactful narrative hooks that players, new or existing, can pick up and run with. These hooks, if developed on in-character, can be marked for XP by both the GM and the player who invoked it. These can be lore elements, mysteries, or even entire lost kingdoms.

GM's can also help with character approvals if they wish. The process for this involves:
1. Checking the character sheets for anything that stands out as against server rules.
2. Helping develop the character concept when requested or as needed.

The [[Game Points|reward system]] for GM's is under development.
