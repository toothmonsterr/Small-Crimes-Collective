**Materials**, which can be gained through session rewards, events, and downtime foraging, is most often used to craft equipment. Each material come assigned with one or more **tags**, which correlate to the customizations and qualities you are able to craft into your equipment. Each tag is associated with a symbol.

> [!info] Example
> A **Smoldering Rock** gained from the volcanic ashes of the isle would perhaps have a **🔥fire** tag or a **👊tough** tag, which you could use to give the **Resistance: Fire** quality to an accessory.

Materials are situational, and will often be developed by a GM based on what makes sense for a session. For example, a session where the party fights a leviathan may provide a **Water-Logged Scale** **💀dark** **🌠mythic**.

GMs are also able to roll on the [[#Material Generation]] tables when deciding on their session rewards.

Each tag is associated with either an **effect**, **element**, or **rarity**. These categories can be mixed and matched, but a single material **cannot** have more than **one** tag from **each** category. 

> [!info] Example
> A **Mysterious Orb** can be **🔮arcane** + **☀️light** + **🌠mythic**, but it **cannot** be both **🪽pure** and **🔮arcane** effects. Similarly, the material **cannot** have both **☀️light** and **💀dark**, only one or the other element.
### Material Tags
#### Effects
Effects are tags that are associated with mechanical changes, ex. **🔺sharp** adding additional damage to a weapon. Materials should **always** have one of these tags.

| 1d9 | Effect     | Associated Customizations & Qualities            |
| --- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | 🔺sharp    | Powerful, Piercing, Weapon Up                    |
| 2   | 🎯accurate | Accurate, Accuracy Up, Spell Up                  |
| 3   | 🔮arcane   | Elemental, Magical, Magic Up                     |
| 4   | 👊tough    | Swordbreaker, Resistance, Dual Resistance        |
| 5   | 🔳solid    | Defense Boost, Antistatus, Bulwark               |
| 6   | 💠multi    | Quick, Multi, Damage Change                      |
| 7   | 🪽pure     | Immunity, Perfect Health, Healing Up, Omnishield |

| 9   | ☣️rotten   | Status, Status Plus                              |
#### Elements
Elements are tags associated with a damage type, ex. **⚡bolt**. These elements can also be correlated to a status effect, Dazed in the case of **☀️light**. A material lacking one of these tags is considered **unattuned**.

| 1d8 | Element  | Associated Status |
| --- | -------- | ----------------- |
| 1   | 💨air    | +/- HP            |
| 2   | ⚡bolt    | +/- MP            |
| 3   | 💀dark   | Weak              |
| 4   | 🪨earth  | Shaken            |
| 5   | 🔥fire   | Enraged           |
| 6   | ❄️ice    | Slow              |
| 7   | ☀️light  | Dazed             |
| 8   | 🍏poison | Poisoned          |
#### Rarity
Rarity tags are associated with the [[Player Progression#Player Tiers|player tier]] they are attributed to, such as `🌀strange` representing the second tier, levels 10-19.  A material lacking one of these tags is considered **common** or otherwise **basic**. A material will be assigned its rarity based on the session's tier appropriate reward.

| 6   | 📕artifact | N/A                   | Priceless      | N/A                                                |
##### Trading Rare Materials
Rarity tags are locked to their respective tiers of play and cannot be traded to lower tiers of players. 

You can sell materials to other players for whatever price you haggle down to. It is recommended to use a base price of the zenit reward of the session the material was received in.
### Material Generation
These optional tables are to facilitate the creation of materials in leu of developing them ad-hoc. For example, rolling on a creature table based on the type(s) of creature(s) fought will provide you with a unique material related to the session. 
#### Elemental Descriptors
These are raw element descriptors, based on the core game's elemental damages.

#### Effect Descriptors
These are raw effect descriptors, based on the above effect tags. Use these when giving players specifically requested effects, alternatively you can use this table by rolling a 1d9 and choosing the associated column, then rolling the 1d10 for the row.
