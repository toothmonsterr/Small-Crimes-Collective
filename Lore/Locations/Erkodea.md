A country of unending snow in the winter and unending sun in the summer, far to the north of the [[Enigmata|world]]. Currently, it is a moderately rich country with a stable population, but fifty years ago, it was going through a civil war, so there are now plenty of Erkodeans that are scattered through the whole wide world, including in the City of Angels itself. It's experiencing a post-war economic activity- many jobs and rebuilding is afoot. The current authorial figure is a president, and the current political system is a very shaky democracy, with the old nobility dying in the civil war.
