Player characters can write a log, diary entry, spy report, or any sort of documentation after a session in order to earn an additional **+1 XP** per session. There is no limit to the amount of players in a session who can claim this, just that it can only be done once per session. The minimum requirement is simple-- simply write in character about what they thought, experienced, or felt during or after the session.

These should be posted in ⁠the session-log channel and the XP should be claimed in ⁠character-log.
