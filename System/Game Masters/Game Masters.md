## GM Rules
There are only a few prerequisites to being a GM:
1. An approved character
2. **Either** a general understanding of the game's mechanics **or** a willingness to learn them.
3. A willingness to work within established lore & an eagerness to develop more.

In terms of responsibilities, GM's are to run games whenever they are comfortable and able to. There is no requirement for GMing a minimum amount, just a willingness to collaborate and develop stories for others when possible.

Otherwise, the rules are as follows:
1. Cooperate with your players and pay attention to what everybody else is saying. Encourage everyone to play an active role-- each participant should get their time in the spotlight.
2. Play by the rules & play fairly. If you think one or more elements should be altered, discuss the matter with everyone else. Only change those elements if the entire group has agreed on how to do so.
3. Ask questions. Move the action forward by asking questions to everyone else. Propose things before they happen-- but leave the question open ended so players can expand on it as needed.
4. Play to find out what happens & avoid over-planning. Fabula Ultima is a game that embraces open-ended narratives and collaborative storytelling. Try not to railroad your players without good cause.
5. Make good use of villains. Use preexisting ones from the server's villain list, or make your own. Establish their identity and expand on them to further the story of the server as a whole.
6. Document your session's rewards as well as the session's length in hours. These can be posted in the [session-log](https://discord.com/channels/1382793642871099392/1393344882839654562) channel using the pinned template. Rewards have a base of zenit, material, and XP. There are [[Rewards|recommended rewards]] and [[Materials#Material Generation|roll tables]] available as guidelines.
7. Record your [[Hooks]]. Hooks are things that come up in play that are unresolved but can be followed up on outside of the current session. These should be impactful narrative hooks that players, new or existing, can pick up and run with. These can be lore elements, mysteries, or even entire lost kingdoms. View the pins in the hooks channel for more rules regarding hooks.

GM's can also help with character approvals if they wish. The process for this involves:
1. Checking the character sheets for anything that stands out as against server rules.
2. Helping develop the character concept when requested or as needed.
3. Making sure the character has followed the steps of [[Character Creation]] correctly. Check that the character has all three Traits (Identity, Theme, & Origin), exactly 5 levels of classes across 2-3 classes, starting zenit associated with a visible roll in character-logs, and equipment available in [[Marketplace#Basic Equipment|the basic equipment list]]. As well, if there is a class or quirk feature that needs documenting (e.g. an Heirloom weapon, or Pilot vehicle modules), make sure that is listed as well.

The [[Lore Points|reward system]] for GM's is under development.
