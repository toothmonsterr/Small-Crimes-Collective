Whereas [[Anatoly, the First Begotten]] could survive anything thrown at him, regenerating what he lost within hours at most, the rules of survival within the [[Angelic Night]] are a bit different:

Lethal injuries are not lethal in that time period, but a person needs to have their body parts in place to survive. A punctured lung or a stabbed heart would heal by the end of the Angelic Night, but if someone's head was torn apart but not returned to place during the time frame of the Angelic Night, the person truly dies.

Having said that, it still depends on what body part the person loses- you could heal a torn off finger if you get it back during the Angelic Night, but you wouldn't die if you don't have it back by then. You would need to visit [[Doctors Within Borders]], though, as while they don't have to reattach every single nerve and blood vessel, you would need to have your arm stay in a cast if it gets torn off.

The price of revival, however, is allowing the city's liminal nature to seep into you. For example, something strange could grow back after the head blows up, or a person could get infinitely more layers of skin instead of scar tissue, or a bullet hole could turn into a permanent blank spot after a person is shot with a gun.

There is no limit to how twisted a person could become from these beautiful, Angelic Nights.
