The Weave isn't magic, precisely. Rather, it is the raw material from which magic is woven, not entirely unlike how a collection of threads is shaped and formed into a garment. It is the fabric on which magic is drawn.

Some people have easier access to it than most, but most people need to rely on conduits to access the Weave, and thus channel magic for their use.
