Sessions give out rewards to both players and GMs. The base rewards for the first 4 hours are as follows for each player in a session:

| Tier      | Material Reward                 | Zenit Reward | XP Reward |
| --------- | ------------------------------- | ------------ | --------- |
| 1 (5-9)   | 1 x ❇️crafted or 2 x common     | 250z         | +5 XP     |
| 2 (10-19) | 1 x 🌀strange or 2 x ❇️crafted  | 400z         | +5 XP     |
| 3 (20-29) | 1 x ✨enigmatic or 2 x 🌀strange | 500z         | +5 XP     |
| 4 (30+)   | 1 x 🌠mythic or 2 x ✨enigmatic  | 800z         | +5 XP     |

For every **hour** past the **first four,** the rewards are as follows:

| Tier      | Material Reward | Zenit Reward | XP Reward |
| --------- | --------------- | ------------ | --------- |
| 1 (5-9)   | 1 x common      | 100z         | +1 XP     |

| 4 (30+)   | 1 x✨enigmatic   | 400z         | +1 XP     |

> [!tip] Example
> A tier 3 quest that lasted 6 hours would give out one ✨enigmatic material and two  🌀strange materials, as well as 1000 zenit and +7 XP.*
> 
> \* Not including any additional XP from Fabula or Ultima points spent

It is recommended GM's use the [[Materials#Material Generation|material generation tables]] when needed.
