A land locked nation, if one had to define a trait of the nation, it would be preparedness. Bordering the zealots of [[the Holy Kingdom of Bave]], the country had time and time again made the mistake of not being prepared. A crusade would be declared and though they would survive, it would be at great cost.

One day, they would accept it no longer. They created a weapon far greater than any before, a defense unbreakable. What it is, nobody truly knows. What is known is that munition dumps would mysteriously explode in the lead up to the next Holy Kingdom crusade. A string of scandals exposed surrounding their top generals. The sabotage or theft of proprietary technologies. All that was known was that these incidents seemed to regularly occur just before harm seemed to come to Atlas, and would blunt the damage they delt more often than not.

Since these mysterious events began to occur, the nation has had a long period of prosperity. Developing into a regional power, it is well known for its exports in technology and military assets.
