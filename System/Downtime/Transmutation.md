Transmutation of [[Materials]] and equipment [[Qualities]] or [[Crafting#Custom Weapons|Customizations]] requires the use of [[Downtime]] and a level or more in one of three classes: Chimerist, Floralist, or Invoker. Transmuting involves changing the innate nature of an existing object to be of a different [[Materials#Material Tags|material tag]], i.e. a different effect, element, or rarity.

You can only transmute material or one piece of equipment a day, and it uses your [[Downtime#Regular Actions|Regular Action]] of the day.

The rules for material transmutation are as follows:
* When transmuting material, you can only change one material tag at a time.
* Materials cannot have two of the same type of tag, meaning you can only transmute tags from the same category (i.e. effect, element, or rarity)
* You cannot transmute rarity tags to higher tiers, i.e. you cannot transmute a **ðŸŒ€strange** tag to a **ðŸŒ mythic** tag. However, you **can** reduce the rarity tag to a lower tier.

The rules for transmutation of equipment qualities are as follows:
* Transmuting existing equipment negates the need for base equipment costs.
* You are **replacing** the existing quality with a new one. Rare equipment is limited to one quality for each piece of equipment.
* You must have or be provided the material required for the new quality.
* Custom weapons can have their customizations changed in this way.
