Creating a character in Small Crimes Collective involves developing a character in Fabula Ultima and submitting it through a process of approval in order to make sure all the pieces fit into existing lore, and that any new lore you add can be properly documented.
## Character Requirements
* Your character must use the [[Fabula Ultima#Approved Content|approved content]] of the server.
* Your character cannot have elements that are listed on our [lines and veils](https://safety.vercel.app/wguzTmQKSfR3XFi-FicRF).
* Your character must be from the world we are creating together. We are collaboratively worldbuilding this setting together, so if you can't find somewhere that fits, feel free to pitch a concept to the server or in your submission.
* Your character must be of age/an adult.
* Your character must be original and not of an existing property.
* Your character must be generally able to fit into a collaborative play setting with other player characters.
## Character Sheets
Players have two options for character sheets:
* Duplicate this [template gsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gRVfD8eeljeorSeOnhEntdsz0aasU7QXAELid90equg/edit#gid=0) and create your character following the guide.
* Create a [Fultimator](https://fabula-ultima-helper.web.app/) account and create your character within the builder tool.
You will submit your character using either of these two tools.
## Creation Process
Character creation largely follows the core rulebook, but is outlined here for clarity.
### Step 1: Traits
To start creating your character, you'll need to develop their **Traits**. These are the core pillars of your character's narrative. Think of them less as constraints to write within and more tools to wield when it makes sense.

Traits are in three categories:
* **Identity** - A short description of your character concept, ex. "The First Begotten".
* **Theme** - A strong ideal, emotion, or lens in which your character operates, ex. "Justice."
* **Origin** - Where your character is from in the world.

If you need help developing any of these, let the community know in the [character-help channel](https://discord.com/channels/1382793642871099392/1382793644167401512). You are free to develop regions, cities, and locales outside [[Twin Star Falls|The City]] for your character to be from, based on the landmasses on the [[World Map]].
### Optional Step: Quirks
Fabula Ultima allows for unique twists on character mechanics called **Quirks.** Your character can have **one quirk** at any given time. These quirks are found in the expanded Atlases. If you do take a Quirk, check the **Additional Tables** tab on your sheet. Copy the Quirk table and paste it into your Main Sheet so its features are clear to you and others.
### Step 2: Classes
Choose two OR three (not more or fewer) classes to start with. You have five levels to input into these classes. Note down the **Free Benefits** and **Skills** gained from each class you take.
### Step 3: Attributes
Set your core attributes with one of the following spreads. 
- **Jack of All Trades**: d8 / d8 / d8 / d8
- **Average**: d10 / d8 / d8 / d6
- **Specialized**: d10 / d10 / d6 / d6
Assign these dice to your **Dexterity (DEX)**, **Insight (INS)**, **Might (MIG)**, and **Willpower (WLP)**.
### Step 4: Starting Zenit
To determine your starting Zenit, roll for it in the [rolls-log](https://discord.com/channels/1382793642871099392/1392976635195818164) channel. Use the following format:
```!r 500+2d6*10 [Your Character Name here] starting zenit```
### Step 5: Starting Equipment
To start with, you can spend your starting zenit on any **Basic** equipment, as listed in the core rulebook. More official shop documents are to come.
### Step 6: Finishing Touches
To round out your character, it's time to determine their **name**, **pronouns**, **appearance**, and **biography.** Name, pronoun, and a short biography is required for submission. If you want to use art for your character, keep in mind that we have a **no generative AI** rule on the server for artwork.
## Submission
Now it's time to submit your character. This is a collaborative process, so there may be some edits or suggestions made to allow your character to best fit into the world.

To start, create a post in the [character-profiles](https://discord.com/channels/1382793642871099392/1382793643974201573) channel with the following:

* Name - the name or moniker of your character.
* Pronouns - the character's pronouns of choice.
* Origin - where the character is from, pre-established or of your own creation
* Classes - the two to three classes you selected during creation
* Sheet - a link to your Google sheet (make sure it's set to public) or Fultimator sheet 
* About - Some history/profile/descriptions of your character, as brief or as long as you'd like.
* Art (optional) - any character art you may want to use as reference.

A GM will make a thread from your post to review it, discuss with you, and suggest changes as needed. These threads are public, and other players can view or make suggestions as well.

Once you're approved by a GM, you can begin to play! Head over to [[Roleplay & Sessions]] for more information.
