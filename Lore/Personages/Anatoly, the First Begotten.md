A man with horrible luck, who doesn't die when he should. 

He was one of the slaves that [[Ontus the Brave|Ontus]] brought in order to make his new [[Twin Star Falls|city]], but Anatoly started a revolt for freedom, for him and his fellow slaves. It ends with him being executed at gunpoint- except that the [[First Death of Anatoly the Begotten|execution doesn't stick]].

For much of the rest of his life, he’s a subject of notoriety and intense research. Near the end of his life, he’s able to escape his life sentence as a test subject, and finally dies of old age, with the freedom he sought.
