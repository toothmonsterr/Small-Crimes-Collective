No one knows exactly why the Leviathans of the sea are so gigantic and magically powerful.

Some say that these monsters are that way because they sink deep into the sea, far too close too to the Stream of Souls, and so they got affected by the powers that reside in it. Others that that these beasts are not native to the world of Enigmata, but have actually formed in the Stream of Souls, and only appear in places where the unseen veil that separates souls from the physical world is thin.

Whichever case it might be, the Leviathans had left their mark on all civilizations that grew on the world of Enigmata. For example, it is theorized that [[Erkodea]]'s old national dragon, the *zmei*, was one of those Leviathans.
