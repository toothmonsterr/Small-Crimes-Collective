Citizens of [[Twin Star Falls]] know when the [[Angelic Night]] falls using the Light.
The Light is not, as a matter of fact, a single light. Rather, it is a switch inserted in every lamp post in the city that makes the white/yellow light of them shine red, allowing every person with a window open to know that the Angelic Night is here. It was invented by [[Spanner, Inventor of the Light]], who used the riches of his invention to create the empire that is [[SpannerWorks Mega-Corp]].
