Creating a character in Small Crimes Collective involves developing a character in Fabula Ultima and submitting it through a process of approval in order to make sure all the pieces fit into existing lore, and that any new lore you add can be properly documented.

## Character Requirements
* Your character must use the [[Fabula Ultima#Approved Content|approved content]] of the server.
* Your character cannot have elements that are listed on our [lines and veils](https://safety.vercel.app/wguzTmQKSfR3XFi-FicRF).
* Your character must be from the world we are creating together. We are collaboratively worldbuilding this setting together, so if you can't find somewhere that fits, feel free to pitch a concept to the server or in your submission.
* Your character must be of age/an adult.
* Your character must be original and not of an existing property.
* Your character must be generally able to fit into a collaborative play setting with other player characters.
## Character Sheets
Players have two options for character sheets:
* Duplicate this [template gsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gRVfD8eeljeorSeOnhEntdsz0aasU7QXAELid90equg/edit#gid=0) and create your character following the guide.
* Create a [Fultimator](https://fabula-ultima-helper.web.app/) account and create your character within the builder tool.
You will submit your character using either of these two tools.

## Creation Process
Character creation largely follows the core rulebook, but is outlined here for clarity.
### Step 1: Traits
To start creating your character, you'll need to develop their **Traits**. These are the core pillars of your character's narrative. Think of them less as constraints to write within and more tools to wield when it makes sense.

Traits are in three categories:
* **Identity** - A short description of your character concept, ex. "The First Begotten".
* **Theme** - A strong ideal, emotion, or lens in which your character operates, ex. "Justice."
* **Origin** - Where your character is from in the world.

If you need help developing any of these, let the community know in the [character-help channel](https://discord.com/channels/1382793642871099392/1382793644167401512). You are free to develop regions, cities, and locales outside [[Twin Star Falls|The City]] for your character to be from, based on the landmasses on the [[World Map]].
