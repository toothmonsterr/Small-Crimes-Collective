Lore Points (or LP) are the currency for the reward system for [[Game Masters]], lore writers, and any other administrative tasks within or beyond the standard game master's role. LP is most often spent on narrative progression-- such as leveling up villains, establishing factions and threats, and progressing world clocks.

View [[NPCs & Villains#Villains|villain rules]] for more information.
