The core system we use in roleplay and sessions is Fabula Ultima, a JRPG-inspired TTRPG with a focus on worldbuilding, epic narratives, and quick-paced action. It's a character-focused game that emphasizes making grounded characters in the world you create together.

## Server Errata
This server has some base changes to the default rules in the core rulebook, but they are subject to change on a GM-by-GM basis.
### Initiative
Conflict scenes now follow a simple rule for determining which side goes first: if the conflict features no Villains, the heroes' side wins initiative. If the conflict features one or more Villains, the enemy side wins initiative. This change has consequences throughout the system.
* Rules and effects that affect initiative no longer exist.
- Armor no longer gives initiative penalties.
- NPCs no longer have Initiative, so elite and champion foes do not increase it.
### Tonics
The effect of the tonic becomes: One creature recovers from all status effects.
### Designing NPCs
* The Use Equipment Skill no longer exists. Humanoids have 4 free initial Skills, just like Monsters. They may wield equipment, from a narrative standpoint, but mechanically these are just normal basic attacks, spells, or unique actions.
* NPCs can no longer choose Class Skills, only NPC Skills. Effects such as the Protect Skill (see Grey Howler, page 325), can be recreated via the "Reaction" NPC Skill, for instance.
### Studying a NPC
Instead of being revealed at 10+, 13+ and 16+, the various degrees of NPC data are revealed at 7+, 10+, and 13+.
### PC Bonds
You can have an unlimited number of bonds towards other player characters, but they will not count past the total of 6 for any skills or class features that scale off of bonds.
