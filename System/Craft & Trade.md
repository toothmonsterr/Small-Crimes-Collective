Crafting equipment can be done with **materials**, which can be gained through session rewards, events, and downtime foraging. Each material come assigned with one or more **tags**, which correlate to the qualities you are able to craft into your equipment. Each tag is associated with a symbol.

> [!info] Example
> A Smoldering Rock gained from the volcanic ashes of the isle would perhaps have a ðŸ”¥ `fire` tag or a ðŸ‘Š`tough` tag, which you could use to give the `Restistance: Fire` quality to an accessory.

Materials are situational, and will often be developed by a GM based on what makes sense for a session. For example, a session where the party fights a leviathan may provide a **Water-Logged Scale** ðŸ’€`dark`âœ¨`mythic`.

GMs are also able to roll on the [[#Material Generation]] tables when deciding on their session rewards.

Each tag is associated with either an **effect**, **element**, or **composition**. 
* Effects are tags that are associated with mechanical changes, ex. ðŸ”º`sharp` adding additional damage to a weapon.
* Elements are tags associated with a damage type, ex. âš¡`bolt`.
* Composition are tags associated with the structure of a material, ex. a ðŸ”—`metal` tag would be applicable to crafting steeled weapons and iron armor.
