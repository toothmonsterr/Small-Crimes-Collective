Anatoly is brought in front of King Ontus,forced to kneel in front of him, after his slave revolt is suppressed. The King gloats of his victory, and orders his soldiers to shoot Anatoly to death.

They shoot him once, and he falls to the floor... only to raise his head back again, a few seconds after.

King Ontus orders the executioners to shoot again. Anatoly rises again.

After the third time, Anatoly's executioners are too terrified to shoot him again, and the revolting slaves gain the vigor to fight again, reasoning that they were supported by God, leading to a bloody conflict that had the rebels get literally shot down, but that nonetheless did nothing but add a halo on Anatoly's actions, everyone being secretly convinced that he was supported by the Heavens.
