Nikolai Vasilyevich Drakonov is a mafioso with tremendous wealth in the underworld and plenty of favors to a myriad of people. He does not offer power, because he likes to hold the reins tightly in his hand, but he does offer abundance. In fact, there is one particular [[Agents of Chaos|agent of chaos]] who was being being paid generously to keep killing Nikolai for as long as Nikolai likes.
