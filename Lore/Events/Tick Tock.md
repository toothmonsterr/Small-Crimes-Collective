[[Leonid Yakovich]] arrives to the city to experience all kinds of deaths that could be offered to him during the [[Angelic Night]]- a more extreme version of skydiving, he claims it to be. 

He breaks the balance by dying when be shouldn't.

## The Fallout

- [[Death Tourism]] as well as all kinds of industries that relied somewhat on immortality immediately fall into chaos as their chief mode of operation breaks down.
- The [[Agents of Chaos]] become disorganized as it is revealed that Leonid was their boss, and a mad struggle for power among them ensues.
- With no way to predict whether each evening brings with it the kiss of life, the elite begin offering up a scapegoat each night. A single life: if they die, it’s a normal night; if they live, the Angels come.
