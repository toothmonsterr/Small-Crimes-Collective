Downtime actions are based off of real world time and are associated with two categories: **regular** and **progress**.
## Regular Actions
**Regular** actions are able to be done **once a day**, with a reset of your daily allowance at **midnight EST**, meaning you do not need to wait a full 24 hours to do your daily downtime. These actions are free and do not cost resources unless specified.

The regular actions available are as follows:
* Forming Bonds with Players or NPCs
* Resting
* Working a part-time job
* [[Crafting#Transmutation|Transmuting]] materials
### Bonds
Bonds can be formed with any player character or NPC you have interacted with. You must have an established relationship with the PC to form a bond with them. Every bond starts with a strength of 1 and a single emotion unless otherwise stated by a feature or quirk, ex. the Fettered Heart quirk.

Bonds formed must be logged in downtime-log using the following format:
```
Character: [Character Name]
Action: Bonds with [Character Name]
Bond Level:
Emotion(s):
```

It is also recommended you log it in your character's profile thread.
### Relaxing
Relaxing can be done once a day, and will have the benefit of charging your HP and MP up to full. You still have to [[Marketplace#Replenishing|replenish your IP]] through spending zenit, which you can mark in the market-log channel.

You gain **+1 Fabula Point** every time you relax provided you have **less than 4 Fabula Points**. You cannot gain more than 4 Fabula Points by relaxing.

Resting also triggers Skills from classes that provide resources each time you **Rest**. Otherwise, those effects only happen during Games. This includes but is not limited to gaining money from **Winds of Trade** as a Merchant and gaining ingredients from **Cooking** as a Gourmet. Though, you can only benefit from each of these features once per week.

Relaxing must be logged in downtime-log using the following format:
```
Character: [Character Name]
Action: Relaxes
Gains: [+1 Fabula Point|Cooking|Etc]
```
### Part-Time Work


### Transmutation


## Progress Actions
**Progress** actions require the use of a currency known as **Echo Points** (EP). All characters start with **4** EP, and more are gained on a weekly basis. Characters gain **2** EP at the start of every Saturday (midnight EST), and can have a **maximum** of **8** EP.

Progress actions currently available are as follows:
* [[Crafting#Creating Equipment|Creating Equipment]] through crafting
* Tinkerer Projects
* Gourmet Projects
* Retraining
* Research

To start a Progress action,
### Progressing the Clock
Progress actions are almost always associated with a Clock. Progressing the clock **requires** spending EP to progress it. The exchange rate is generally 1 EP per tick on the clock.

Other players, as long as they share a prerequisite class for the task at hand (ex. a Weaponmaster & a Commander), can help progress preexisting clocks provided they have discussed it with the clock's owner. The exchange rate remains 1 EP per tick, but from the other player's EP pool.

In some circumstances, such as difficult projects or world-changing artifacts, progressing the clock may also require a successful check. When present, failing this check can cause complications to the action or even reverse the clock. 
### Equipment Crafting
Creating equipment with EP is generally based on the rarity of the [[Materials]] required. For example, a [[Crafting#Custom Weapons|Custom Weapon]] at is base level only requires **common** materials, so it would only cost 1 EP to craft. In this case, a clock is not required, however a **üå†mythic** material would have a clock with 8 ticks.

Crafting does not require checks to progress clocks.

| Rarity     | Total EP Cost | Clock Segments |
| ---------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| common     | 1             | N/A            |
| ‚ùáÔ∏ècrafted  | 2             | 2              |
| üåÄstrange  | 4             | 4              |
| ‚ú®enigmatic | 6             | 6              |
| üå†mythic   | 8             | 8              |
