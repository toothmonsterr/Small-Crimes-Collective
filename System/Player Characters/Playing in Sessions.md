Playing the game in Small Crimes Collective is done primarily through either [[Roleplay]] or **sessions**, which are differentiated by whether or not there is a GM present.  Sessions are done with a GM running the game, usually with a larger amount of players, and at a specific time with all players present.
## Session Rules
Sessions are announced by GMs in the scheduling channel. Sessions should have a time listed, an expected duration, a title, and a short description. Sessions will be listed as either Voice or Play-by-Post (PBP) and may have a player tier restriction for balancing. As well, if any specific players are requested, they should be mentioned along with their character. If a specific VTT is required, it will be listed, and players are expected to be able to use said VTT when playing.

Each session will be scheduled with an Apollo event that allows users to mark their availability. To submit your character to the session for selection by the GM, paste your character information in the thread using the following format:
```Name:
Pronouns:
Classes:
Total Level:
Sheet:
```

The rules for playing in a session are as follows:
1. Respect the GM and your fellow players. Communication is key. Regular server rules and roleplay rules are applicable.
2. Try to avoid playing in sessions when distracted. It can be disrespectful to your GM and fellow players to be multitasking when in a session. Sometimes it can't be helped, but still, prioritize the session and be clear with everyone when you may be distracted or AFK.
3. Every roll is visible, including the GM's. Use a dice bot like Avrae to make your rolls for everyone to see.
### Rewards
Sessions reward XP, with a bare minimum of +5 XP per session.
* Every player in a session gains **+5 XP** for any session 4 hours or less, with an additional +1 XP for every hour past the first 4.
* A player spending a Fabula Point grants **+1 XP** for **that player and that player only.**
* A [[NPCs & Villains#Villains|villain]] appearing grants +1 XP for **each player in the session.**
* A villain spending Ultima Points grants +1 XP to  **each player in the session.**

As well, players will get a sum of zenit and a session-relevant material, which can be used in crafting and trade. These rewards will be listed in the session log. The guidelines for session rewards are [[Rewards#Session Rewards|here]].
### Requesting Sessions
Any player can request a session for any GM to run. This can be as specific or as vague as you wish, but it's helpful for GM's to have a general idea of your expectations for the session so they can best plan for it.

To request a session, go to the [session-requests](https://discord.com/channels/1382793642871099392/1393336879352643676) channel. Use the following format and ping the GM role:
```
Desired Gameplay: [RP/Exploration/Combat/ETC]
Tier: [The tier of the character you hope to play]
Desired Time: [Use a hammertime code for this]
Desired Format: [VC/PBP and/or TotM/VTT]

[Description of session concept]
```
## Player Logs
Player characters can write a log, diary entry, spy report, or any sort of documentation after a session in order to earn an additional **+1 XP** per session. There is no limit to the amount of players in a session who can claim this, just that it can only be done once per session. The minimum requirement is simple-- simply write in character about what they thought, experienced, or felt during or after the session.

These should be posted in ⁠the session-log channel and the XP should be claimed in ⁠character-log.
## GM Logs
GM logs require the following:
* The total length of the session in hours.
* Player rewards as per the [[Rewards#Session Rewards|Session Rewards]] table. By default, each session provides a minimum of +5 XP, an amount of zenit based on player tier, and one or two [[Materials]]. As well, be sure to mark any XP gained by villain actions.
