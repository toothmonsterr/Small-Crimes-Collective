Crafting can be done with the use of [[Materials]] and [[Downtime]]. Players can craft the types of equipment based on their classes. Equipment marked ‚ú¶ means that class can make Martial variants of the specified equipment type as well as the base variant. As well, specific classes are able to [[Crafting#Transmutation|transmute]] materials into other types of materials.

## Creating Equipment
The type of equipment you create is determined by the materials you use and the classes you can craft with. Materials with tags related to **effects** will provide access to customization and quality options, for example.
### Custom Weapons
Custom Weapons must be crafted or traded and cannot be created at character creation. A custom weapon can be crafted with [[Materials#Rarity|common materials]], provided the materials have the effect attributes related to the customization.

A custom weapon starts with the following characteristics:
* Belongs to one Category of your choice (arcane, bow, brawling, dagger, firearm, flail, heavy, spear, sword, or thrown).
* It is not a martial weapon (‚ú¶) but may become one depending on customizations. You can only customize a weapon to be martial if your class is able to craft martial‚ú¶ melee and/or martial‚ú¶ ranged weapons.
* It is a two-handed weapon and will always occupy both hands.
* It is your choice of melee or ranged, regardless of the category you chose.
* It has a base cost of 300 zenit.
* Its Accuracy Check relies on„ÄêDEX + INS„Äë or „ÄêDEX + MIG„Äë (your choice).
* It deals physical damage equal to „ÄêHR + 5„Äë.

A custom weapon can be created with **up to three** customizations. 
* Each customization can only be chosen once for the same custom weapon.
* Choosing a customization marked with ‚ú¶ turns the weapon into a martial weapon.
* Some especially powerful customizations count as two customizations or increase the cost of the custom weapon.
* Each customization requires a material with the associated material tag. You cannot give a weapon the Defense Boost customization without using a üî≥solid material in its crafting.

The available customization for weapons are in the following table.

| Material Tag                                            | Customization Name                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

If one or both the forms are martial (‚ú¶), remember that you must have the appropriate Classes to equip and craft them. Additionally, a transforming weapon can still only have one Quality (the Quality applies to both forms). |
### Rare Equipment
Rare equipment is any equipment with an added [[Qualities|Quality]], a specific boon or otherwise mechanical change applied to the equipment. Equipment is grouped into the categories of [[Crafting#Weapon Allowances|weapons]], [[Crafting#Armors & Shields|armor & shields]], and [[Crafting#Accessories|accessories]].

Rare equipment will never have more than a single Quality. The quality you're looking to add to the equipment also defines the material you need to craft it with. The rarity of the material used will determines the equipment's rarity. You **cannot** use **more than two*** materials to craft a weapon, and each weapon will require 2-3 tags on the material(s) to craft, based on its quality and associated rarity.

Qualities **cannot** be stacked, meaning you cannot benefit from the same quality twice.
#### Weapons
Rare weapons are based on either an existing [[Marketplace|basic weapon]] or a custom weapon previously crafted. If its base is a martial ‚ú¶ weapon, or if its damage modifier is +10 or higher, it is classified as a martial ‚ú¶ weapon.

Rare weapons have the following **free** allowances for changes:
* A weapon can be changed from two-handed to one-handed if you *decrease* its damage by 4. Likewise, a weapon can be changed from one-handed to two-handed with an *increase* in damage by 4.
	* Weapons from the brawling, dagger, and thrown categories cannot be two-handed.
	* Custom Weapons cannot be one-handed.
#### Armors & Shields
Rare armor is crafted based on existing basic equipment. If its base is considered martial ‚ú¶, so is its crafted variant.
#### Accessories
Accessories are always considered rare, as they have no basic equivalent, and one can only equip one accessory at a time.
